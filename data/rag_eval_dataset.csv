" was taking on Nigerians and to bring an end to what had become a terrifyingly profitable industry.
We were left with one enduring question: why did the campaign fail?
Six weeks after we started, the campaign received donor funding. By then, there were reports that some of the kidnapped students were gravely ill, and two more had been murdered: Feso Osunlalu, a third-year student of international relations, and Shaheed Abdulrahman, a first-year student who had been kidnapped the very day he started at Greenfield. But, on 29 May 2021, all the survivors of the Greenfield kidnapping were released after a ransom of 150 million naira (around $375,000) was paid, together with the delivery of eight new, fuelled motorbikes. Some parents, still in debt today, had to sell properties, crowdsource and borrow to make up their contributions to the ransom. Neither the Kaduna state government nor the federal government were involved in the negotiations or tried in any way to alleviate the financial burden on parents.
From the Secure our Lives campaign
Though relieved by their release, we carried on with the campaign because kidnappings at schools continued to occur. We began to put together a coalition of feminist, civil society, media and faith-based organisations that were involved in security, gender equity, human rights protection, and access to education.

" message ‘Look at how very scientific I am.’
After the Great Recession, the failure of economic science to protect our economy was once again impossible to ignore. In 2009, the Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman tried to explain it in The New York Times with a version of the mathiness diagnosis. ‘As I see it,’ he wrote, ‘the economics profession went astray because economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth.’ Krugman named economists’ ‘desire… to show off their mathematical prowess’ as the ‘central cause of the profession’s failure’.
The mathiness critique isn’t limited to macroeconomics. In 2014, the Stanford financial economist Paul Pfleiderer published the paper ‘Chameleons: The Misuse of Theoretical Models in Finance and Economics’, which helped to inspire Romer’s understanding of mathiness. Pfleiderer called attention to the prevalence of ‘chameleons’ – economic models ‘with dubious connections to the real world’ that substitute ‘mathematical elegance’ for empirical accuracy. Like Romer, Pfleiderer wants economists to be transparent about this sleight of hand. ‘Modelling,’ he told me, ‘is now elevated to the point where things have validity just because you can come up with a model.’
The notion that an entire culture – not just a few eccentric financiers – could be bewitched by empty, extravagant theories might seem absurd.

" the three different neutrino identities. ‘DUNE will measure that mixing angle, and all the physics linked to it,’ Sousa explains. The mixing angle is a set of numbers that indicate how far nature deviates from a simple, mathematically idealised form of symmetry – the kind of sad symmetry that would have led to an empty, barren reality.
While DUNE is busy looking for oscillating neutrinos, it will be taking on many other physics jobs as well. It will search for hypothetical, heavy neutrinos that could explain the unseen dark matter that appears to outweigh all the visible matter in the Universe. These ‘sterile’ neutrinos, if they exist, must be even more inert than the regular kind; they could hide an entire shadow realm of previously unseen physics. The DUNE detectors will function as an ultra-sensitive neutrino telescope, a greatly enhanced version of the experiment Davis began at the same site in the 1960s. If a supernova blows up anywhere in our galaxy, scientists will know it, and will get a unique look into the heart of a dying star – a view that only neutrinos can provide. ‘We would learn so much,’ Sousa says.
DUNE seems like a modern cathedral – a place of congregation where people seek enlightenment

Neurotech – think of Elon Musk’s much-hyped Neuralink initiative for hooking up brains to machines – connects to the fantasy of mind-uploading, which Musk believes is possible. ‘We could download the things that we believe make ourselves so unique,’ he said in an interview in 2022. ‘As far as preserving our memories, our personality, I think we could do that.’ Musk says that a long-term goal for Neuralink is to ‘store your memories as a backup.’ These ideas, it’s important to recognise, are not to be confused with ambitious extrapolations of current scientific capabilities; they aren",What is Elon Musk's vision for Neuralink as mentioned in the paragraph?,"Elon Musk envisions Neuralink as a means to connect brains to machines, with the long-term goal of storing memories as a backup.",https://aeon.co/essays/no-suffering-no-death-no-limits-the-nanobots-pipe-dream,87,87_chunk_17_870df89f
" nimble, negotiable system that enables people with separate bodies to achieve joint agency without giving up behavioural flexibility and social accountability. So before we throw out language because of its supposedly low data rate, let’s look a bit more closely at the ways in which it helps us calibrate minds, coordinate bodies and distribute agency. There are two features of language that make it especially useful in human interaction: selection and negotiation.
Selection is the power we have to select what to keep private and what to make public by putting it into words. Sharing and withholding information are among the most important ways in which we manage our social relationships. Nobody in their right mind wants to blurt out every fleeting thought and feeling. Society as we know it largely depends on the fact that some things are better left unsaid. So language gives us control over what we share with whom, and whether we share something in the first place. Take a simple question such as ‘How are you?’ The words you select in response to it have more to do with social relations than with information: this is how you distinguish between the delivery driver and your best friend. This is the power of selection in action.
If we weren’t judiciously wielding the power of selection throughout the day, awkwardness would accumulate and social life would be sent into gridlock. To avoid this, we have, as a society, tacitly agreed to limit self-disclosure.

" a way that satisfies and responds to constituent desires.
Both flaws in the current system stem from the same cause: national sovereignty. While governance responsibilities are distributed among many levels, ultimate authority at present sits with only one institution, the nation-state. As a result, global governance institutions and local governments are subordinate to sovereign nation-states. Nation-states can – and sometimes do – delegate authority to international and subnational institutions, but that authority is subject to a limit: it cannot interfere with whatever the nation-state deems to be its sovereignty. The result of this constraint is that local-scale issues often aren’t governed robustly, and planetary-scale issues rarely are.
Adequately governing these many scales requires two significant changes to the worldwide architecture of governance: introducing new scales of institutions and transforming how governance authority is distributed through the system.
To simplify matters, let’s consider three primary scales of governance: local, national and planetary. Each is designed to manage the appropriately scaled issues and challenges, and together they operate as a system.

Indeed, the irony of their predicament is that Rabelais’s humanist characters harp on the necessity of establishing a dialogue with Picrochole, but prevent it happening with the very language in which they express the importance of hearing his perspective.

In the classic Book of Documents , the legendary sage king Yao transfers the throne to his successor with mention of a single duty: ‘Yao said: “Oh thou, Shun! The li numbers of heaven rest in thy person.”’
China’s oldest mathematical text invokes astronomy and divine kingship in its very title – The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon of the Zhou . The title’s inclusion of ‘Zhou’ recalls the mythic Eden of the Western Zhou dynasty (1045–771 BCE), implying that paradise on Earth can be realised through proper calculation. The book’s introduction to the Pythagorean theorem asserts that ‘the methods used by Yu the Great in governing the world were derived from these numbers’. It was an unquestioned article of faith: the mathematical patterns that govern the stars also govern the world. Faith in a divine, invisible hand, made visible by mathematics. No wonder that a newly discovered text fragment from 200 BCE extolls the virtues of mathematics over the humanities. In it, a student asks his teacher whether he should spend more time learning speech or numbers. His teacher replies: ‘If my good sir cannot fathom both at",What does the newly discovered text fragment from 200 BCE indicate about the value of mathematics compared to the humanities?,"The text fragment indicates a preference for mathematics over the humanities, as a student is advised to focus on numbers.",https://aeon.co/essays/how-economists-rode-maths-to-become-our-era-s-astrologers,11,11_chunk_9_18d1edf0

The combined share of the population following Islam and Christianity in Kerala is about 45 per cent; for India as a whole, it is 16.5 per cent.

"I first learnt about Plato’s allegory of the cave when I was in senior high school. A mathematics and English nerd – a strange combination – I played cello and wrote short stories in my spare time. I knew a bit about philosophy and was taking a survey class in the humanities, but Plato’s theory of ideal forms arrived as a revelation: this notion that we could experience a shadow-play of a reality that was nonetheless eternal and immutable. Somewhere out there was a perfect circle; all the other circles we could see were pale copies of this single Circle, dust and ashes compared with its ethereal unity.
Chasing after this ideal as a young man, I studied mathematics. I could prove the number of primes to be infinite, and the square root of two to be irrational (a real number that cannot be made by dividing two whole numbers). These statements, I was told, were true at the beginning of time and would be true at its end, long after the last mathematician vanished from the cosmos. Yet, as I churned out proofs for my doctoral coursework, the human element of mathematics began to discomfit me. My proofs seemed more like arguments than irrefutable calculations.

" either save a human from a minor injury or save a pig from a major injury. In this case, it might be that you should save the pig.
Similarly, even if a human has more at stake than one nonhuman, they might not have more at stake than many nonhumans. Suppose you can either save a human from a minor injury or save 1,000 pigs from minor injuries. In this case too, it might be that you should save the pigs.
Finally, morality is about more than benefits and harms, at least in practice. We would never permit doctors to breed humans for their flesh or organs, since the rights of the ‘donors’ would trump the benefits for the recipients. Why not think that the same can be true for nonhumans?

" but none for deliberation either. Its effect is as immediate as it is involuntary. We can admire the sheer efficiency of this form of interaction, but we also have to admit that something is lost. A sense of agency and autonomy; and along with that, perhaps even a sense of self. Nor does this problem go away merely by upgrading bandwidth, as is Musk’s ambition for Neuralink, his implantable brain-computer interface. The very possibility of social (as opposed to merely symbiotic) life depends on there being some separation of private worlds, along with powers to interact on our own terms. In other words, we need something like language in order to be human.
When we directly connect one individual’s mental life to that of another, individual agency might slip through our fingers. Biology offers plenty of examples. Take the fascinating slime mould Physarum polycephalum , which is essentially a bag of cytoplasm holding millions of individual nuclei, the result of a mass merger of amoebae. Moving and sensing in unison, the slime mould can crawl towards light, find food in mazes, and even mimic the design of urban metro networks. The price for this perfect symbiosis is a complete loss of autonomy for individual elements. The real challenge for brain-to-brain interfaces is not to achieve some interlinking of brains. It is to harness technology in a way that doesn’t reduce people to the level of amoebae fused to a slime mould.

"1970, that meant about 3.8 million people out of 96 million – are believed to have ever belonged to one. What they did, however, was give voice to ordinary people, and empower the progressive wing of the Church, which was calling for a more democratic approach to faith and wider society.
The 1968 General Conference of the Bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean (CELAM) held in Medellin, Colombia saw the nascent movement that would become known as liberation theology begin to take its first steps. The bishops issued a document that understood three meanings of poverty: an evil God does not want; spiritual poverty, or a readiness to do God’s will; and, finally, solidarity with the poor. The conference also consciously introduced the term ‘liberation’ to the cause for spiritually led societal change.
