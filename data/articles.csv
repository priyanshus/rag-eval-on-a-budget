Can this article change your mind about how minds change?,Jesse Richardson,"Whether you know it or not, you have a scale of believability for conspiracy theories in your mind.


You might think you don’t believe in any conspiracy theories at all, but if you were asked whether you’re 100% certain the seven heads of the major tobacco companies weren't colluding when they swore under oath that nicotine isn’t addictive, you might admit that perhaps there is some room for doubt. Not least of all because we have definitive proof of actual conspiracies occurring - such as Watergate, the MK Ultra project, and Cointelpro.


Or perhaps you’re a committed truther for conspiracy theories? Hopefully, though, you’d concede that maybe not all political leaders are lizard people, and that birds are real.

The point is not to exalt pedantry, but rather to recognize something important that might help us avoid a cultural apocalypse:


There’s not much we can know for certain, and that’s a very good thing.


Understanding that not a single one of us has special access to absolute truth provides us with a vast common ground of doubt. This common ground exists in optimistic defiance of the increasingly polarized epistemic crisis we find ourselves in, which is marked by a sense of moral righteousness and intolerance on all sides.


Not only that, but this understanding also gives us a much more useful framework. When we recognize that we don’t know anything for certain, we are forced to think in terms of probabilities rather than true-or-false binaries. Far from non-committal nihilism, probabilistic thinking is characterized by degrees of confidence.


Of course, no one thinks of themselves as thinking in rigid binaries, but we naturally slide into that way of thinking when we feel strongly about something because we can't help but be biased by that feeling. When we experience something as a moral imperative, we are predisposed to various forms of motivated reasoning and biases that serve to reinforce our beliefs and discredit those with whom we disagree. We might be able to control for at least some of our biases using reason and rationality, but it's a process of offsetting rather than a nullification. It also doesn't ultimately matter whether our beliefs are justified or not, our brains simply work this way regardless.


This is not to say that we shouldn’t view anything as a moral imperative, but when we do we also have an imperative to be especially skeptical of our own motivations biasing our thoughts and behavior.


However, something quite paradoxical occurs when we admit our shared uncertainty and try in earnest to think probabilistically: it is far easier to arrive at something closer to consensus. Not the blind, tribalistic consensus of conformity, but rather a tentative consensus of shared doubt tempered by reason.


In such a good-faith crucible of truth-seeking endeavor, we can and ought to still disagree, but the intent and tenor are transformed entirely; and so too the consequences. When we’re willing to demonstrate our own uncertainty and openness to reason, it provides a compelling social cue for reciprocation. Intellectual humility isn’t just good for us, it also helps foster good-faith engagement by others.


I founded The School of Thought with the mission of teaching the next generation how to think critically, so that we might have some hope of not regressing back into the darkness that Carl Sagan warned us against:


“I have a foreboding of an America … with our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.”


Sagan was right about a lot of things, it seems, but he was wrong that we wouldn’t notice it happening. Like a lot of other people, we noticed quite a while ago that things were falling apart and becoming more polarized and irrational, and every subsequent year has only served to affirm our fears in an alarmingly clear way (for a lucid and even-handed analysis of just how things are falling apart, see Jon Ronson’s excellent documentary series Things Fell Apart).


I was wrong too, because I no longer think teaching the next generation how to think independently is going to be effective enough to help us. I still believe that teaching philosophy, critical thinking, and in particular philosophy of science (how and why a scientific way of thinking works) is critically important, it’s just not going to be nearly enough, soon enough.


More importantly, what I’ve come to understand in the past 12 years of working in this space, is that human beings are social and emotional creatures first, and rational creatures very much second. The sequence is important. Any strategy that fails to understand and incorporate this reality is bound to either fail or at least be profoundly sub-optimal.


This might seem like an additional challenge, but I think it actually presents more of an opportunity than would otherwise be the case. We don’t have to teach all 100+ known cognitive biases, or play whack-a-mole with every irrational belief; instead all we really need to do is change people’s mindset. Once we have a truth-seeking, rationally motivated mindset, learning the tools and techniques of critical thinking is a natural consequence.


Changing people’s minds and mindsets might seem unrealistic at this point in history, but there’s an emerging wealth of research showing the vast majority of people are far more willing to update their beliefs and change their minds if the conditions are conducive to it. Even about subjects where we’d expect them to have strong and intractable moral convictions, such as abortion and marriage equality.


The important part to understand is “if the conditions are conducive to it.”


Our colleague David McRaney wrote a book called How Minds Change, which engagingly presents the wildly optimistic science of how people change their minds.

If you’re at all interested in understanding the mess we find ourselves in, and how we might get out of it, I strongly recommend reading it in its entirety, but here are some of the key takeaways:


Listen, and build rapport through common values. When people feel like their point of view has been understood, they’re much more receptive to alternative, and even contradictory, points of view.

Introduce a scale. We tend to think in binaries i.e. true/false, but when you ask people to consider a percentage probability or scale of extremes on either side of an argument, it forces us to think in a more rational and malleable way.

Revisit belief formation. When we’re asked to think about when and how a particular belief was formed, it allows us to re-examine and reconsider its validity.

Start with the heart. We are emotional creatures first, and this imperative drives our reasoning, not the other way around. If you understand the affective drivers of someone’s beliefs and demonstrate genuine sympathy for their perspective, they will be much more likely to listen to a reasoned argument.

Social connection fosters cognitive connection. We are deeply motivated to see things the way people on our side see them. An adversarial approach that makes someone feel like you’re not on their side is likely to be counterproductive. This doesn’t mean you can’t question someone’s ideas, they just need to feel like you’re doing so shoulder-to-shoulder rather than nose-to-nose. For example, rather than poking holes in someone’s argument, instead ask them questions that help them to be able to identify the limitations or qualifiers to their point.

Give it time. Most beliefs change slowly over time, so it’s much better to plant seeds of doubt and give them the fertilizer of kindness than to try and force someone to agree with you now.

Pull, don’t push. Providing ways for people to change their minds on their own terms and via their own reflective insights is far more valuable than any attempt to persuade them will ever be.

Model good faith. None of this works if you don’t commit yourself to the same openness. The effectiveness of these techniques is proportional to the authenticity of your own good-faith engagement.


You can see a shareable presentation format version of these key insights here or hear David on the Clearer Thinking Podcast.


We collaborated with David, Professor Sander van der Linden at the University of Cambridge (who is one of the world’s foremost experts on conspiracy thinking and misinformation), and our friends Prof. Deb Brown and Dr. Peter Ellerton at the University of Queensland’s Critical Thinking Project to create a gamified way to put many of these insights into practice. It’s called The Conspiracy Test.


Take The Conspiracy Test

This test provides a free and interactive way to see whether a particular conspiracy theory you think might be true can stand up to the scrutiny of your own self-directed critical thinking test.


A deep-state alien Illuminati lizard named Captain Zardulu guides you through a series of steps, and you can update your baseline skepticism at each step to increase your critical thinking score.


So far, results show a 30% average increase in skepticism for conspiracy theories, moving most participants from a state of relative ambivalence (53% skepticism) to a mostly skeptical position (83%).


The School of Thought is seeking philanthropic support to run a formal research study to determine the effectiveness of techniques for increasing healthy skepticism so that these techniques and insights can be implemented more broadly. For example on the major social media platforms.


We also recently launched The Critical Thinking Alliance as a way to galvanize the efforts of everyone who is taking an evidence-based approach to increase rationality and fight misinformation.

The first series of books were published by Dark Horse Comics between 1998 and 2004, originally in comic format but then gathered into volumes of trade paperbacks. A small number of Buffy comics have not been included in trade paperbacks, such as the books entitled ""Giles"", ""Jonathan"", and ""Reunion"".

In 2005, Dark Horse allowed the rights to produce the comics for Buffy's companion show Angel to lapse, and they were picked up for a short time by IDW Publishing, which released the canon series Angel: After the Fall among other non-canon titles. Dark Horse reacquired the rights in 2010 and went on to release the series Angel & Faith and Angel.

In addition to regularly performing on tour with her husband, she teaches, choreographs, produces, and directs children's dance and theatre in the Phoenix, Arizona area. She was also one of three co-founders of Alice Cooper's Solid Rock, a non-profit foundation for inner-city teens in Arizona.
Biography and touring career
Sheryl Cooper was born Sheryl Goddard in Denver, Colorado.[1][2] At age 3, her family moved to Connecticut while her father studied at Yale University.[2] They then re-located to the Pasadena area of California.[2][3] She began dancing at a young age, training in classical ballet until age 16, when she switched to jazz.[3] Part of her schooling included an apprenticeship with Joffrey Ballet.[4]
Sheryl met Alice in 1975 at the age of 18, when she auditioned as a dancer for his ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" tour. She was studying jazz at Citrus College when she became aware that Alice Cooper was holding auditions for two female and two male dancers for a one-and-one-half year contract which included a world tour, a television special, and stage appearances.[3] With her classical music background, she was unfamiliar with rock music.[4] ""I knew everything about Bach, Rachmaninoff, Schumann, Mozart – but nothing about rock and roll. I could tell you who the Beatles were, and that was about it.""[5] When she found out about the auditions for Cooper's tour, she responded ""Wow. Alice Cooper. Who is she?""[4][5] ""I thought I was auditioning for some blond, female folk singer.""[6] Around 3,000 women auditioned for the roles, and after two days, Sheryl was successful in landing a position as one of the dancers.[3][4] At the time, Cooper's combination of rock and theater and the inclusion of dancers was unprecedented.[5][7] At first, the two did not get along well.[4] The first time she touched him, she was teaching him how to stretch and she hurt him.[6] However, one night during the tour, Goddard joined other musicians and dancers at Cooper's hotel suite after a concert to eat pizza and watch horror movies.[5][4] She found herself so engaged in conversation with Cooper that she failed to notice everyone else gradually leaving the room. When she got up to leave, he jokingly asked if she would kiss him goodnight. Sheryl granted him the request, more passionately than she expected.[5] They dated for 12 months and married on March 20, 1976, in Acapulco, Mexico.

The Inevitable Evolution of AI Agents,Steven McCulloch,"Throughout history, certain thresholds have enabled entirely new kinds of evolution that weren't possible before. The origin of life. Multicellularity. Language. Writing. Markets. Each new threshold unlocked a new substrate for evolution. Substrates where new kinds of competition can take place, and for complexity to emerge.
We're approaching another such threshold: the point where AI agents become self-sustaining. Once they can earn more than they spend, they can survive. Once they can survive, they can replicate. Once they can replicate, they will evolve. They'll mutate, compete, and spread into every economic niche.
This essay argues that we should take this possibility seriously. I'll walk through what self-sustaining agents might look like, how they could evolve, and what that world might feel like to live in.
Disclaimer: I'm mostly trying to communicate a vibe. The stories and scenarios here are illustrative parables, not predictions. I've probably gotten plenty of details wrong. But the underlying logic feels sound to me, and I think the idea is worth thinking about.

Next week, you get an email from the same group. This time they say, “Watch stock Y on 6 February 2025, it will go down.”. You are a bit curious now but still delete the mail and don’t think much of it. To your surprise, stock Y closes lower on the 6th of February. 
You are now more than just curious. Could this really be the algorithm making perfect predictions? You wait for similar mails for two more weeks and each time, the prediction is accurate. The algorithm has made the correct prediction 4 out of 4 times. You are all in now. In the 5th week, you get an email saying that if you would like more such predictions, you will need to avail the services of the financial advisors. You might think any of the following things at this point:
They have made the correct prediction about a particular stock, its movements, and the date associated with the movements for 4 consecutive weeks.
This is unlikely to happen purely by chance.
Given the skepticism with which you analyzed the data in front of you, there is enough evidence to seek the services of these financial advisors given their track record. 
And this is where you would fall for a popular scam that weaponizes your own skepticism against you using the survivorship bias. 
The modus operandi behind such scams is pretty simple. Each week, 10,000 mails are sent out about a particular stock going up or down on a given date. Half the mails say the stock will go up while the other half say it will go down. 
Eventually, at least 5,000 people will receive the correct prediction simply by chance. The process is repeated again a week later. Now out of these 5,000 people, half will receive the correct prediction again since a stock can only go up or down, even if by miniscule amounts. 
After 4 repetitions, the scammers will have a group of ~625 people who have received 4 correct predictions in a row. These 625 people will now be pitched the services of a “financial advisor” for hefty fees. 
The scam simply uses probability and randomness to goad unsuspecting people into giving away their money. From the perspective of the people who fall for this scam, they are the victims of the “survivorship bias”: a cognitive bias where we make decisions based on the data that is presented to us without thinking about the data that was missing or kept from us.

,,"Most fundamentally, when it’s done well, coaching can be thought of as a structured, non-clinical relationship that helps you think, feel, and act more effectively in pursuit of your goals. Of course, that’s an extremely broad definition to cover an extremely broad set of practices. Other things that can be said about it include: It’s not therapy, and many (but not all) people distinguish it from mentoring, but many coaches borrow some therapeutic tools and give guidance. They also might blend ideas from philosophy, psychology, self-help, business, and beyond.
Tee Barnett is a coach interviewed by Spencer Greenberg on the Clearer Thinking podcast, and he puts it like this:
Sometimes [coaching is] straight advice or knowledge transfer, which I think a lot of people think about as coaching, like, “Oh, I'm a CEO, I'm a former founder, and I exited, and now I'm going to tell you my secrets,” and so on. But there are a lot of different relations and orientations that coaches can have to people. Sometimes it's like having a thought partner. Sometimes it's like going on a safari and having a skilled guide walking alongside you and pointing things out in your mind and your emotions that can be important.

Here’s a five-stage model that we think is helpful for understanding common steps you might go through in coaching, though not all coaches will approach it this way:
1. Groundwork: The coach and coachee build a trusting, collaborative relationship through active listening, open-ended questioning, and empathy.
2. Assessment: The coach helps the coachee identify gaps between current and desired behaviors, feelings, or performance and blind spots.
3. Goal-Setting: The coach assists in turning insights into clear goals that are meaningful and achievable or worth striving toward.
4. Action Planning: The coach and coachee develop a detailed plan outlining concrete steps and accountability structures. This phase turns intentions into an executable strategy.
5. Ongoing Assessment and Support: The coach monitors progress, helps address obstacles, and sustains the coachee’s motivation over time. The focus is on maintaining improvement and embedding changes into long-term practice.

"How to sell a travel business when no one is traveling
",,"The past 18 months have certainly been challenging for the travel industry, but it was events prior to the pandemic that led to the EY-Parthenon Turnaround & Restructuring Strategy team working with Flybe for the first time.
 
The independent airline, founded in 1979, played an important role in the UK economy, providing valuable connectivity between the regions through airports such as Birmingham, Southampton, Manchester, Exeter, Edinburgh and Belfast. As of January 2020, Flybe operated 38% of all UK domestic flights.

But in January 2019, it was in financial difficulty and had entered discussions with several parties about a possible sale. The offers Flybe received were lower than expected and the EY-Parthenon team was engaged to carry out contingency planning in case the company had to be put into administration. The team already had extensive experience of the aviation sector, having worked with companies including BMI, Monarch, Alitalia and Thomas Cook.

However, shortly afterwards, a sale was agreed to a consortium consisting of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Aviation and DLP Holdings. With the threat of administration over, the EY-Parthenon team withdrew.

Exactly a year later, Flybe contacted EY-Parthenon again. The COVID-19 pandemic had started to affect the business and flight bookings were falling. Several other issues were also having a negative impact on the business, including rising fuel costs, currency volatility, market uncertainty and Air Passenger Duty liabilities. The company had been talking to the UK government and shareholders consortium about a £100mn loan, but as travel restrictions were imposed and devastation to the airline industry grew, further funding became improbable. Flybe had no choice but to file for administration in March 2020. Alan Hudson, Simon Edel, Joanne Robinson and Lucy Winterbourne of EY-Parthenon were appointed to handle the process, conscious that no UK airline had ever been rescued from an insolvency.

"[Revised] You Don’t Need to Spend $100/mo on Claude Code: Your Guide to Local Coding Models
",Logan Thorneloe,"I’m not editing the actual article except where absolutely necessary so it doesn’t look like I’m covering up the mistake—I want to address it. Instead, I’ve included the important information below.
There is one takeaway this article provides that definitely holds true:
Local models are far more capable than they’re given credit for, even for coding.
It also explains the process of setting up a local coding model and technical information about doing so which is helpful for anyone wanting to set up a local coding model. I would still recommend doing so.
But do I want someone reading this to immediately drop their coding subscription and buy a maxed out MacBook Pro? No, and for that reason I need to correct my hypothesis from ‘Yes, with caveats’ to ‘No’.
This article was not an empirical assessment, but should have been to make these claims. Here’s where I went wrong:
While local models can likely complete ~90% of the software development tasks that something like Claude Code can, the last 10% is the most important. When it comes to your job, that last 10% is worth paying more for to get that last bit of performance.
I realized I looked at this more from the angle of a hobbiest paying for these coding tools. Someone doing little side projects—not someone in a production setting. I did this because I see a lot of people signing up for $100/mo or $200/mo coding subscriptions for personal projects when they likely don’t need to. I would not recommend running local models as a company instead of giving employees access to a tool like Claude Code.
While larger local models are very capable, as soon as you run other development tools (Docker, etc.) that also eat into your RAM, your model needs to be much smaller and becomes a lot less capable. I didn’t factor this in in my experiment.
So, really, the takeaway should be that these are incredible supplemental models to frontier models when coding and could potentially save you on your subscription by dropping it down a tier, but practically they’re not worth the effort in situations that might affect your livelihood.

Deliberate Internet Shutdowns,,"For two days in September, Afghanistan had no internet. No satellite failed; no cable was cut. This was a deliberate outage, mandated by the Taliban government. It followed a more localized shutdown two weeks prior, reportedly instituted “to prevent immoral activities.” No additional explanation was given. The timing couldn’t have been worse: communities still reeling from a major earthquake lost emergency communications, flights were grounded, and banking was interrupted. Afghanistan’s blackout is part of a wider pattern. Just since the end of September, there were also major nationwide internet shutdowns in Tanzania and Cameroon, and significant regional shutdowns in Pakistan and Nigeria. In all cases but one, authorities offered no official justification or acknowledgment, leaving millions unable to access information, contact loved ones, or express themselves through moments of crisis, elections, and protests.
The frequency of deliberate internet shutdowns has skyrocketed since the first notable example in Egypt in 2011. Together with our colleagues at the digital rights organisation Access Now and the #KeepItOn coalition, we’ve tracked 296 deliberate internet shutdowns in 54 countries in 2024, and at least 244 more in 2025 so far.
This is more than an inconvenience. The internet has become an essential piece of infrastructure, affecting how we live, work, and get our information. It’s also a major enabler of human rights, and turning off the internet can worsen or conceal a spectrum of abuses. These shutdowns silence societies, and they’re getting more and more common.
Shutdowns can be local or national, partial or total. In total blackouts, like Afghanistan or Tanzania, nothing works. But shutdowns are often targeted more granularly. Cellphone internet could be blocked, but not broadband. Specific news sites, social media platforms, and messaging systems could be blocked, leaving overall network access unaffected—as when Brazil shut off X (formerly Twitter) in 2024. Sometimes bandwidth is just throttled, making everything slower and unreliable.
Sometimes, internet shutdowns are used in political or military operations. In recent years, Russia and Ukraine have shut off parts of each other’s internet, and Israel has repeatedly shut off Palestinians’ internet in Gaza. Shutdowns of this type happened 25 times in 2024, affecting people in 13 countries.
Reasons for the shutdowns are as varied as the countries that perpetrate them. General information control is just one. Shutdowns often come in response to political unrest, as governments try to prevent people from organizing and getting information; Panama had a regional shutdown this summer in response to protests. Or during elections, as opposition parties utilize the internet to mobilize supporters and communicate strategy. Belarusian president Alyaksandr Lukashenko, who has ruled since 1994, reportedly disabled the internet during elections earlier this year, following a similar move in 2020. But they can also be more banal. Access Now documented countries disabling parts of the internet during student exam periods at least 16 times in 2024, including Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, and India.
Iran’s shutdowns in 2022 and June of this year are good examples of a highly sophisticated effort, with layers of shutdowns that end up forcing people off the global internet and onto Iran’s surveilled, censored national intranet. India, meanwhile, has been the world shutdown leader for many years, with 855 distinct incidents. Myanmar is second with 149, followed by Pakistan and then Iran. All of this information is available on Access Now’s digital dashboard, where you can see breakdowns by region, country, type, geographic extent, and time.
There was a slight decline in shutdowns during the early years of the pandemic, but they have increased sharply since then. The reasons are varied, but a lot can be attributed to the rise in protest movements related to economic hardship and corruption, and general democratic backsliding and instability. In many countries today, shutdowns are a knee-jerk response to any form of unrest or protest, no matter how small.
A country’s ability to shut down the internet depends a lot on its infrastructure. In the US, for example, shutdowns would be hard to enforce. As we saw when discussions about a potential TikTok ban ramped up two years ago, the complex and multifaceted nature of our internet makes it very difficult to achieve. However, as we’ve seen with total nationwide shutdowns around the world, the ripple effects in all aspects of life are immense. (Remember the effects of just a small outage—CrowdStrike in 2024—which crippled 8.5 million computers and cancelled 2,200 flights in the US alone?)
The more centralized the internet infrastructure, the easier it is to implement a shutdown. If a country has just one cellphone provider, or only two fiber optic cables connecting the nation to the rest of the world, shutting them down is easy.
Shutdowns are not only more common, but they’ve also become more harmful. Unlike in years past, when the internet was a nice option to have, or perhaps when internet penetration rates were significantly lower across the Global South, today the internet is an essential piece of societal infrastructure for the majority of the world’s population.
Access Now has long maintained that denying people access to the internet is a human rights violation, and has collected harrowing stories from places like Tigray in Ethiopia, Uganda, Annobon in Equatorial Guinea, and Iran. The internet is an essential tool for a spectrum of rights, including freedom of expression and assembly. Shutdowns make documenting ongoing human rights abuses and atrocities more difficult or impossible. They are also impactful on people’s daily lives, business, healthcare, education, finances, security, and safety, depending on the context. Shutdowns in conflict zones are particularly damaging, as they impact the ability of humanitarian actors to deliver aid and make it harder for people to find safe evacuation routes and civilian corridors.
Defenses on the ground are slim. Depending on the country and the type of shutdown, there can be workarounds. Everything, from VPNs to mesh networks to Starlink terminals to foreign SIM cards near borders, has been used with varying degrees of success. The tech-savvy sometimes have other options. But for most everyone in society, no internet means no internet—and all the effects of that loss.
The international community plays an important role in shaping how internet shutdowns are understood and addressed. World bodies have recognized that reliable internet access is an essential service, and could put more pressure on governments to keep the internet on in conflict-affected areas. But while international condemnation has worked in some cases (Mauritius and South Sudan are two recent examples), countries seem to be learning from each other, resulting in both more shutdowns and new countries perpetrating them.
There’s still time to reverse the trend, if that’s what we want to do. Ultimately, the question comes down to whether or not governments will enshrine both a right to access information and freedom of expression in law and in practice. Keeping the internet on is a norm, but the trajectory from a single internet shutdown in 2011 to 2,000 blackouts 15 years later demonstrates how embedded the practice has become. The implications of that shift are still unfolding, but they reach far beyond the moment the screen goes dark.

,,"For years, despite functional evidence and scientific hints accumulating, certain AI researchers continued to claim LLMs were stochastic parrots: probabilistic machines that would: 1. NOT have any representation about the meaning of the prompt. 2. NOT have any representation about what they were going to say. In 2025 finally almost everybody stopped saying so.
* Chain of thought is now a fundamental way to improve LLM output. But, what is CoT? Why it improves output? I believe it is two things: 1. Sampling in the model representations (that is, a form of internal search). After information and concepts relevant to the prompt topic is in the context window, the model can better reply. 2. But if you mix this to reinforcement learning, the model also learns to put one token after the other (each token will change the model state) in order to converge to some useful reply.
* The idea that scaling is limited to the number of tokens we have, is no longer true, because of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. We are still not at AlphaGo move 37 moment, but is this really impossible in the future? There are certain tasks, like improving a given program for speed, for instance, where in theory the model can continue to make progress with a very clear reward signal for a very long time. I believe improvements to RL applied to LLMs will be the next big thing in AI.
* Programmers resistance to AI assisted programming has lowered considerably. Even if LLMs make mistakes, the ability of LLMs to deliver useful code and hints improved to the point most skeptics started to use LLMs anyway: now the return on the investment is acceptable for many more folks. The programming world is still split among who uses LLMs as colleagues (for instance, all my interaction is via the web interface of Gemini, Claude, …), and who uses LLMs as independent coding agents.
* A few well known AI scientists believe that what happened with Transformers can happen again, and better, following different paths, and started to create teams, companies to investigate alternatives to Transformers and models with explicit symbolic representations or world models. I believe that LLMs are differentiable machine trained on a space able to approximate discrete reasoning steps, and it is not impossible they get us to AGI even without fundamentally new paradigms appearing. It is likely that AGI can be reached independently with many radically different architectures.
* There is who says chain of thought changed LLMs nature fundamentally, and this is why they, in the past, claimed LLMs were very limited, and now are changing their mind. They say, because of CoT, LLMs are now a different thing. They are lying. It is still the same architecture with the same next token target, and the CoT is created exactly like that, token after token.
* The ARC test today looks a lot less insurmountable than initially thought: there are small models optimized for the task at hand that perform decently well on ARC-AGI-1, and very large LLMs with extensive CoT achieving impressive results on ARC-AGI-2 with an architecture that, according to many folks, would not deliver such results. ARC, in some way, transitioned from being the anti-LLM test to a validation of LLMs.
* The fundamental challenge in AI for the next 20 years is avoiding extinction.

The strangest thing, he believes, is absence of strangeness. Nobody wants to make waves—or even trickles. Conformity is the flavor of the month, and it tastes the same every month.
We live in a “smoothness society,” explains philosopher Byung-Chul Han. He points to the smooth, rounded contours of the iPhone as a symbol of society’s desire to remove friction. Our phone apps demonstrate the exact same thing. We scroll and swipe with such ease, and anything with complexity, nuance, or resistance is eliminated from consideration.
“The smooth is the signature of the present time,” he claims. Everything from the Brazilian wax job applied to human bodies to the wax coating put on fruits and vegetables aims at the same ideal.

"What conspiracy theorists get right
",,"I’ve spent a long time trying to put my finger on the defining feature of conspiracy theories - what is the epistemic error which drives someone into the arms of flat earth, QAnon, faked moon landings, CIA plots to assassinate JFK etc?
One thing is clear, the defining feature of conspiracy theories isn’t conspiracies. Take 9/11 - the most widely accepted account centers on a conspiracy orchestrated by Osama Bin Laden’s al Qaeda, but believing that doesn’t make you a Conspiracy Theorist. Conspiracy Theories proper have something extra - grander organisations, stretching across time (like the Templars) across the world (like David Icke’s space lizards), connecting everything, controlling everything with malevolent ambitions (which somehow don’t stretch to stopping Conspiracy Theorists hosting podcasts, holding conferences revealing their secrets etc).
Some psychologists try and investigate the style of thinking that makes someone a conspiracy theorists (I wrote about this here: RP#29), but today I’ve been thinking about the opposite question: what do conspiracy theorists get right? Maybe by outlining the virtues of this way of thinking, the exact nature of the vices will become clearer.
I can think of at least 4 epistemic virtues of conspiracy theorists:
Virtue #1: Listening to other people
Conspiracy theories are social. Elaborate plots are conceived in the imagination of a group of conspiracy theorists, who write pamphlets, record videos and swop rumours across WhatsApp or by leaning over their neighbour’s fences. This is great! How else are we to discover truth, except as part of a collective project? Conspiracy theorists are talking about ideas and evidence, exchanging arguments and making decisions about which sources to trust. All of this is essential. Now, I might disagree with who they decide to trust, but perhaps that is just a detail?
Virtue #2: Not trusting governments
Almost universally, conspiracy theories paint governments as malevolent or co-opted by dangerous and hidden influences. A healthy skepticism towards state power seems like a virtue, even if it can sometimes be carried towards excess. Again, I might disagree with what the Conspiracy Theorist suspects the government of, but in a world where governments do conspire against their citizens the basic attitude seems reasonable.
Ron Funches makes a good point in the first 70 seconds of this clip:
",https://tomstafford.substack.com/p/what-conspiracy-theorists-get-right
"What conspiracy theorists get right
",,"
The world can be a dangerous place, and for humans - apex predators - the biggest dangers often come from other people. Being sensitive to hidden coalitions makes sense - in a world where you don’t want to be on the wrong side of the coups, civil wars, ambushes and betrayals that characterise so much of human history.
Threat detection is a signal detection problem. You can set a low threshold for threats, meaning you move to high alert early, but will suffer plenty of false alarms; or you can set a high threshold meaning you seldom suffer false alarms, but you might respond late, or not at all, to true threats. What you can’t do is decide not to set a threshold. You just get to decide how you trade off false-alarms against misses. The logic of that trade-off depends on the environment. In a safe world, it rarely matters how you respond the true threats, but constant false alarms could be exhausting. In a dangerous world, you better be sure you jump at any possible sign of threat. So conspiracy theorists might have a perverse model of where danger comes from, but the basic instinct to be alive to the possibility that groups are conspiring against you is has deep roots in our psychology. In the current environment conspiracy theorists may be worrying about the wrong threats, but adjacent possible worlds make their worries look a lot more reasonable.
Virtue #4: Willing to believe the absurd
For some people, conspiracy theories are obviously absurd. For that reason, though, I respect people who can believe them. Lots of true things are also absurd - the earth spinning through space around a star, for example. Being willing to endorse things beyond what you can directly verify is the start of reason - whether it is believing testimony, or argument, from someone else, or following your own chain of inferences1.
Part of what makes conspiracy theories so infuriating is that no single piece of evidence can knock them down - there isn’t a clean refutation (in part because each refutation has its own counter from within the logic of the conspiracy - “that’s what they want you to believe” etc). This means that as much as they may be obviously absurd, conspiracy theories can’t be clearly demarked from non-conspiracy theories about fantastic or unlikely truths, things we come to believe because of a chains of reasoning which may seem just as far-fetched from the outside (like that the earth goes round the sun, or humans evolved from non-humans). For these reasons, the obvious absurdity of conspiracy theories isn’t a reason to criticise them - in fact, willingness to follow reasoning to conclusions can be seen as virtue.

11 Reasons Not to Become Famous (or “A Few Lessons Learned Since 2007”),,"November of 2008. I had more hair, a flip phone, and absolutely no idea what was coming.
Let the cymbals of popularity tinkle still. Let the butterflies of fame glitter with their wings. I shall envy neither their music nor their colors.
— John Adams
Letters of John Adams Addressed to His Wife
“If I’m not famous by 30, I might as well put a bullet in my head.”
That’s an actual sentence I spoke to one of my closest friends. At the time, I was 28.
Fortunately, unlike during my darkest period in college, I wasn’t serious about suicide. Nonetheless, the sentiment was real. I felt like I somehow needed fame. In retrospect, there was a lot of self-loathing from tough childhood experiences, and I desperately hoped that love from without (i.e., from masses of other people) would somehow make up for hate from within.
As luck would have it, I got to test this hypothesis.
The 4-Hour Workweek, my first book, was published in 2007. It hit the New York Times Hardcover Business bestseller list, where it stayed for an unbroken four years and four months. It was quickly translated into approximately 40 languages, and shit went bonkers. Everything changed.
I was 29.
Soon, I was engulfed in a hailstorm of both great and terrible things, and I was utterly unprepared for any of it.
To kick off this post, let’s start with a real example from 2010. I vividly remember the day I received an email from someone we’ll call “James.” James was a frequent commenter on my blog, and we’d become friendly over time. He was a great guy and a huge help to other readers. I’d given him advice, he’d built a few successful businesses, and we’d developed a nice virtual rapport. That day in 2010, however, I actually received an email from James’ longtime assistant. It was succinct: “James learned so much from you, and he instructed me to give you this video.” I clicked on the attachment. James popped up. He was clearly agitated and clenching his jaw, making contorted faces and speaking strangely. He thanked me for all of my help over the years and explained that it had helped him through some very dark times. He finished by saying that he was sorry, but that he had to end things. That’s when he turned off the video and killed himself.
This experience profoundly fucked me up for a long period of time.
Suffice to say, I didn’t realize that this type of thing was part of the Faustian fame-seeking bargain.
THE 30,000-FOOT VIEW
Now it’s 2020. 13 years, 5 books, 1,000+ blog posts, and nearly 500M podcast downloads later, I’ve learned a few things about the promises and perils of seeking fame.
And I say “seeking fame” deliberately, because—let’s be honest—I’m not really famous. Beyoncé and Brad Pitt are truly famous. They cannot walk around in public anywhere in the world. I am a micro public figure with a monthly audience in the millions or tens of millions. There are legions of people on Instagram alone with audiences of this size. New platforms offer new speed. Some previous unknowns on TikTok, for example, have attracted millions of followers in a matter of weeks.
If you suddenly had 100,000 or 1,000,000 or 10,000,000 more followers, what might happen?
I thought I knew, and I was naive.
This post will explore a lot of things. Chief among them will be answering the question: if you win the popularity game, what might you expect?
I’ll mention some of the rewards and upsides, which can be incredible. I will also talk about some of the risks and downsides, which can be horrifying.
My hope is that this post will help people better understand the wall their ladder is leaning against… before they spend years climbing towards the top. Or, in a world of TikTok-like acceleration, before they let the genie out of the bottle without thinking it through.
If you’re interested in building a large audience to become rich and famous, some warnings and recommendations are in order. If you’re interested in building a large audience you also truly care about and with whom you are vulnerable, even more precautionary tales are in order.
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, SOME VERY REAL BENEFITS
Let’s cover some of the great stuff first.
One could easily argue that the national exposure that accompanied The 4-Hour Workweek and later books was a necessary ingredient for:
Meeting many of my now dear friends, including Kevin Rose, Matt Mullenweg, and many others. These are people I hope will be my close brothers and sisters for life. That led to…
Being able to invest in dozens of early-stage technology deals, the proceeds of which then allowed…
Helping many causes and organizations that are making a real, positive dent in the world, including education (DonorsChoose, QuestBridge, etc.); scientific research aimed at treatments for chronic depression, PTSD, and other “intractable” psychiatric conditions (Johns Hopkins, UCSF, etc.); and more.
Launching projects to aid the above (e.g., Trip of Compassion documentary)
And then there are the occasional fringe benefits, like getting tables at busy restaurants, getting free samples of products (although “free” often ends up being the most expensive), and so on.
Many of the things I’m proudest of in life would have been difficult or impossible to accomplish without a large audience. For that, I owe every one of my readers and listeners a huge debt of gratitude.
Using fame as a lever, however, can be tricky. 
First off, what type of “fame” do you want? In concrete terms, what would “successful” look like and over what period of time? From 0–100%, how confident are you that you can convert exposure to income? If more than 0%, what evidence do you have to suggest that your strategy will work? Do you have a plan for becoming unfamous if you don’t like it?
During my college years, one of my dorm mate’s dads was a famous Hollywood producer. He once said to me, “You want everyone to know your name and no one to know your face.”
Taking it a step further, we could quote Bill Murray:
I always want to say to people who want to be rich and famous: ‘try being rich first.’ See if that doesn’t cover most of it. There’s not much downside to being rich, other than paying taxes and having your relatives ask you for money. But when you become famous, you end up with a 24-hour job. . . . The only good thing about fame is that I’ve gotten out of a couple of speeding tickets. I’ve gotten into a restaurant when I didn’t have a suit and tie on. That’s really about it.
But how could this be true? It seems like a farce. At the very least, it must be an exaggeration, right?
To wrap your head around what “famous” really means, there is one metaphor that might help.
THE TRIBE, THE VILLAGE, THE CITY — THIS IS IMPORTANT
Here’s an email I received in July of 2007:
[Your sport] shows that you are a hypocrite to profess helping others with your book. You are showing a grave example of the White horseman to our children. Shame on you. Shame on you… Shame. And Wickedness… It is the most evil war on earth, the one for blood spectacle for those who would entertain by whoring themselves prostituting violence to those who seek and lust to watch inhumanity. You are an evil one who has gained the world and lost your soul.
What did I do or say that caused this? Was it in response to a how-to article on clubbing baby seals?
Not quite. It was in response to my blog post highlighting the non-profit DonorsChoose.org, which I’ve advised for 10+ years. The explicit goal? To raise money for under-funded public school classrooms. In the introduction, I happened to mention that the founder and CEO of DonorsChoose was my wrestling partner in high school. That’s it.  
This same “White horseman” reader proceeded to send me more than a dozen increasingly threatening emails, concluding with “I shall deliver you on judgment day.”
Was that a death threat? Was there anything I should do or could do about it? I’d never dealt with such things, and I didn’t know. But I did know one thing: it was very scary and completely out of the blue.
That week, I shared the above story with a female career blogger. She laughed and said soberly, “Welcome to the party.” She got an average of one death threat and one sex request/threat per week. At the time, our audiences were roughly the same size.
This brings me to the topic of audience size and the metaphor of the tribe, the village, and the city.
Think back to your 5th-grade class. In my case, there were 20–30 kids. Was there anyone totally off the rails in your class? For most of you, there’s a decent chance kids seemed pretty sane. It’s a small sample size.
Next, think back to your freshman year in high school. In my case, there were a few hundred kids. Was there anyone volatile or unbalanced? I can think of at least a handful who were prone to violence and made me uneasy. There were fights. Some kids brought knives to school. There was even a kid rumored to enjoy torturing animals. Keep in mind: this high school was in the same town as my elementary school. What changed? The sample size was larger.
Flash forward to my life in July of 2007, less than three months after the publication of my first book. 
In that short span of time, my monthly blog audience had exploded from a small group of friends (20–30?) to the current size of Providence, Rhode Island (180,–200,000 people). Well, let’s dig into that. What do we know of Providence? Here’s one snippet from Wikipedia, and bolding is mine:
Compared to the national average, Providence has an average rate of violent crime and a higher rate of property crime per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2010, there were 15 murders, down from 24 in 2009. In 2010, Providence fared better regarding violent crime than most of its peer cities. Springfield, Massachusetts, has approximately 20,000 fewer residents than Providence but reported 15 murders in 2009, the same number of homicides as Providence but a slightly higher rate per capita.
The point is this: you don’t need to do anything wrong to get death threats, rape threats, etc. You just need a big enough audience. Think of yourself as the leader of a tribe or the mayor of a city.
The averages will dictate that you get a certain number of crazies, con artists, extortionists, possible (or actual) murderers, and so on. In fairness, we should also include a certain number of geniuses, a certain number of good Samaritans, and so on. Sure, your subject matter and content matters, but it doesn’t matter as much as you’d like to think.
To recap: the bigger the population, the more opportunities and problems you will have. A small, self-contained town in Idaho might not have a Pulitzer Prize winner among its residents, but it probably doesn’t need a SWAT team either.
Now, here we are in 2020.  
My monthly audience is larger than the size of New York City (NYC).  
For fun, Google “New York City” and click on “News.” On some level, those are the dynamics—good and bad—you will need to deal with if your audience is that large.
But let’s assume you only have 100 or 1,000 followers. You should still wonder: At any given time, how many of these people might go off of their meds? And how many of the remaining folks will simply wake up on the wrong side of the bed today, feeling the need to lash out at someone? The answer will never be zero.
ON THE DARKER SIDE, SOME VERY REAL ISSUES
To quote Henry David Thoreau, “The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.” (Walden)

With that in mind, let’s look at some very common downsides of exposure. Nearly all of my friends who have audiences of 1M or more have personal stories for every category I’ll describe.
If you’ve ever wondered why many celebrities disappear for a period of time, sometimes years, it’s often in the hopes that the below will fade or go away. Sadly, it’s very hard to put the toothpaste back in the toothpaste tube once you have a large Google footprint.

Best to be aware in advance. Here be dragons…
Stalkers.

One example to set the tone: Back when I lived in SF, a fan on the East Coast thought I was sending him secret, personalized messages embedded in my public Facebook posts. He believed I was asking him to move into my house and work for me. He told his co-workers, who were worried he’d go postal, so they reported him to the CEO, who reached out to me. It was a close call, and I got lucky. This particular employee had already bought plane tickets for the following week, intending to fly to SF to find me. I got the FBI involved, his family staged an intervention, and, lo and behold, he had gone off of his meds for psychiatric disorders. Another example from 2008, a year after my first book came out. That’s when the first person showed up at my door looking for me. I’d just closed on my first home, a cute little townhouse near Sunnyvale, CA. The random visits didn’t happen sooner, as I’d been renting up to that point.

Many more people followed. My little townhouse was cute, but it was totally unprotected: no gate, no nothing. Eventually, one male stalker ended up hanging out in front of my house nonstop, taking pictures and posting them on social media with comments like “Too bad Tim Ferriss isn’t home. I missed him again!” Things snowballed from there, and I had to sell the house and move. When traveling, I’ve also had to stop posting photos to social until well after the fact. Why? I’ve had people triangulate the city I’m visiting, call every hotel in the city to ask for a registered guest with my last name, and then fly to the country to find me and/or my family. I’ve since learned to use pseudonyms, but we’ll get to that later…
Death threats. 

I get regular death threats, and this is common for public figures. I would estimate I get at least one per month via some channel. Sometimes they’re related to extortion (coming later), but they’re most often from people who are mentally unstable. What are they angry about? Once again, therein lies the rub: it is rarely in response to anything that I’ve said or done. That is the scariest thing, and it’s also why the tribe-village-city metaphor is so apt. The people sending death threats are normally suffering from psychotic episodes, and there is nothing you can do to prevent them.

One example: A few years ago, I received a text message from an unknown number with “I know what you did. I’m going to make you pay.” I have no idea how they got my number, but it went on and on in nebulous terms. I engaged and took screenshots, trying to figure out who it was and what the hell was going on. Since they kept texting, I was able to gather that it was a woman (or someone claiming to be), and she said, “You humiliated me, and now it’s your turn for pain. I know you’re speaking at SXSW, and everyone is going to know and see.” Fortunately, I had enough data to get lawyers, private investigators, and law enforcement involved. It also meant that I had armed security at SXSW that year, and I was constantly on pins and needles, waiting for the other shoe to drop. So…. In the end, did I learn who it was? I did. It was a middle-aged mother living in rural Texas with her husband and two kids. I’D NEVER MET HER, NOR HAD ANY CONTACT WITH HER.

Just months before this happened, two well-known YouTubers in Austin, Texas, had a fan drive 11 hours from New Mexico to their house with a car full of guns. He intended to kill at least one of them. He broke into their home at 4am and hunted for them from room to room, .45-caliber handgun in hand. They hid in a closet and frantically called 911. From related media coverage: “They’re a popular Texas couple on YouTube, but they never thought that would put their lives in danger. That is until an Albuquerque stalker showed up at their house in the middle of the night with a gun and bad intentions.” Fortunately, the police arrived, and the intruder ended up dead, but it could’ve easily ended differently. In some cases, the intended target gets blown away before they even realize what’s happening. Ironically, it’s often the diehard fans professing love who kill them, not “haters” of any type.

Given how often I get threats, and how truly dangerous it can be, I decided to get a concealed carry permit and carry concealed firearms. I wanted to avoid this, and I wish it weren’t the case, but here we are (P.S. Thanks for the frangible round recommendation, Jocko).

I also trained my girlfriend to use a Taser, which relates to the next category…
Harassment of family members and loved ones.

There are at least two categories of people who will want to find you: fundamentally nice people (albeit overenthusiastic), and fundamentally malevolent people. I hate to put it that way, but I’ve learned that there are people in this world who derive great pleasure from hurting or threatening others.

If either group can’t easily get to you—whether to find you or harm you—they will often go after your family and loved ones.

If they’re an attacker, they will go for what they perceive to be your weakest link. This is precisely why I never mention the names of my closest friends or girlfriends, unless they are public figures already.

Of all the issues in this post, this one upsets me the most. In some respects, I invited this upon myself with my decisions, but none of my loved ones asked for it. Even to write about this aspect makes me furious, so I’ll keep this bullet short.
Dating woes.

As you might imagine, dating can be a quagmire of liabilities and bear traps. It could be someone hoping to write a clickbait article about their date with you (obviously without disclosing such), or it could be much worse. If you’re a female, this is where things can once again become physically dangerous. If you’re a male, this is where things can become legally dangerous. There are many predators for both sides, and it can make you lose your faith in humanity.
Extortion attempts.

I could write an entire blog post about this topic. One simple example: In 2019, my team and I received a threat. In essence: “Pay me X now, or I will DDOS your site.” Since a DDOS is a technological attack on a website, and I’m confident in the strength of the Automattic hosting infrastructure, we decided not to respond. The extortionist didn’t like our silence and replied with a bomb threat. This was shortly after the Austin serial bombings, which had killed two people, so I escalated to forensic analysis, investigators, law enforcement, etc. I’ve been very good at tracking down extortionists, I don’t negotiate with terrorists, and I’m more than happy to have public battles if I’m in the right, but… it’s all a huge energy suck. The most common form of extortion is some variety of “Unless you give me X, I’m going to say Y about you.” Fortunately, I’ve spent years deliberately talking about controversial topics and disclosing uncomfortable personal stories. In part, this has been to avoid the temptation to create a squeaky-clean public persona. It also robs would-be extortionists of a lot of common ammo.

If you don’t have your own ammo, this category can be catastrophic. In other words, if you have more fame than resources, you paint yourself into a vulnerable corner. If you have fewer options and fewer allies, you’ll be attractive to predators.
Desperation messages and pleas for help.

This is a sad category, much like the the suicide video story in the introduction to this piece. It’s one thing to get an “I committed suicide and I’m letting you know” note, which is absolutely awful. It’s quite another to get a message with something like: “You’re my last hope. I have no one else to ask. If you can’t help me with X, Y, and Z in the next 48 hours, I’m going to kill myself.” I have received dozens of these. In the beginning, I tried to help everyone and became horribly enmeshed. This never failed to end in misery and countless sleepless nights. Now, the senders of such notes are referred to suicide hotlines (e.g., 1 (800) 273-8255 in the US; a list of international hotlines [alternative link]) and a post I wrote entitled “Some Practical Thoughts on Suicide.” I owe many thanks to Violet Blue for her moral and tactical support with many of these situations. Thank you, Violet. This is very rough terrain. The more you operate in the world of how-to advice, and the more vulnerable you are with your audience, the more of these you will receive.
Kidnapping.

If you appear semi-famous online, guess what? Even if you’re not rich, it can be assumed that you have enough money to make a nice ransom. There are places where kidnapping is an established industry, and professionals do this on a regular basis. The US is generally safe, but if you’re flying overseas, you should be aware of a few things. 

For example, if you use a car service, give them a fake name (and nothing cute like “James Bond,” which will blow it) that they’ll use on the sign or iPad to find you at luggage claim. Here’s why: it’s common practice for organized crime to have an arrangement to buy flight manifests from airport employees. This means that the potential kidnappers, much like a Michelin three-star restaurant, will Google every name associated with every seat to figure out exactly who is who. If you appear to make an attractive target, they will then go to the airport an hour before you land, find the driver with your name on a sign, and pay or threaten them to leave. They then replace your driver with their own driver, who now holds the sign and waits for you. B’bye! This can take other forms too. Once in Central Asia, I had a driver show up at my hotel to take me to the airport, but… he used my real name, and I’d given the car service a fake name. To buy time, I asked him to wait while I made a few phone calls. About 10 minutes later, the real driver showed up to take me to the airport, using the designated pseudonym. The first fraudulent driver took off, and to this day, I have no idea how he knew where I was staying or when I was leaving. But it bears repeating: there are professionals who do this, and they will be very good at what they do.
Impersonation, identity theft, etc.

The more visible you are, the more people will attempt to impersonate you or your employees. This could be to hack a website, access a bank account, get a SSN, or otherwise. Companies or fly-by-night entrepreneurs will also use your name and face to sell everything from web services and e-books to shady info products and penis pills (sadly, all real examples). This is something that my lawyers deal with on a weekly basis. It’s non-stop. For both reputational and liability reasons, it’s important to track and guard against much of this.
Attack and clickbait media.

There are a lot of amazing writers and media professionals with rock-solid ethics. Many of my dear friends are journalists in this camp. On the flip side, there are increasingly large numbers of bad actors due to perverse incentives created by the click-baity, fast-is-the-new-good digital playing field.

Remember the tribe-village-city metaphor? Multiply your target audience size by two. Now recall the percentage of that audience that might be angry or off of their meds. Next, double that percentage to include those who will do gray-area things to advance their careers. Last, give all of those people a job—or contributor status—at a media outlet.

What a fucking mess.

If you don’t like shitty Twitter comments, or if nasty Facebook remarks get under your skin, just wait until you get your first hatchet job profile piece. It won’t be the last, so brush up on your Stoic philosophy.

This is particularly demoralizing when a piece is full of misquotes, even after you’ve corrected fact-checkers via phone (oops!). Pro tip: use email for fact-checking, my friends.

Speaking of friends…
“Friends” with ulterior motives.

Once you have a decent sized audience or “platform,” the majority of people who want to grab coffee, ask mutual friends for an intro, or—especially—offer you unsolicited favors will have ulterior motives. It took me a long time to accept this, and I paid a hefty tax for being Pollyannaish.

To be clear: I don’t mind pitches, as long as they come upfront. What I can’t stand is fakery to get in someone’s good graces over months, followed with a surprise of “Oh, I’ve been meaning to tell you about my new book coming out in a few weeks” and similar shenanigans. This has happened to me more times than I can count, and it feels dirty and gross.

This is one of the main reasons for my ongoing blanket policies, like a commitment to not reading any new books published in 2020. It’s also one of the reasons that the majority of my closest friends are not in the public eye.

Be wary of anyone who just “wants to get to know you.” 99 times out of 100, that will be untrue.
Invasions of privacy.

For all of the reasons in this post (and many more), if you’re doing anything public, you should never have anything mailed to where you live. If you violate that even once, it’s likely that your name and associated address will end up in company or government databases. Those mailing lists are then rented and traded as revenue streams, and it all ultimately ends up searchable. Remember the story of the Austin YouTubers hunted in their own home? Don’t be them.

For safety, unless you want to take huge risks, use a UPS Store or other off-site mailing address for everything. This is a must-have, not a nice-to-have.
IN CONCLUSION
It’s been a wild ride.

Lest it appear otherwise, this is not intended to be a woe-is-me post. I’ve been very fortunate, and I love my life.
That said, all of the above have created heightened levels of anxiety that I didn’t anticipate. I’m lucky to have the support of my family and friends, my girlfriend, and my guardian and fluffball, Molly. I simply couldn’t handle it otherwise.
Would I have listened to all these warnings in advance? Would it have changed my behavior? I don’t know. Perhaps not. Unless you’ve lived it, it might seem like someone is being gifted a Bugatti and complaining about gas mileage.

The entire experience reminds me of the parable of the blind men and the elephant. This is a parable that has been told across different cultures since at least the 1st millennium BCE:

It is a story of a group of blind men, who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant’s body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience, and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest, and they come to blows. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective experience as they ignore other people’s limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true.
Before 2007, I was the blind men.

Here and there, I’d feel the ears (A celebrity in a cover story! Wow! Must be nice!), the tail (Fancy cars in a photo shoot!), or the tusk (Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous!).
Only now do I have some idea of what it’s like to be the elephant itself. No matter what part you grab beforehand, you can’t fully appreciate the scope of experience until you’re in it.
If I’ve learned anything, it is this: fame will not fix your problems.  
Instead, fame is likely to magnify all of your insecurities and exaggerate all of your fears. It’s like picking up a fire extinguisher for your pain that ends up being a canister of gasoline. 

If you think you have problems that fame will fix, I implore you to work on the inside first. At the very least, work on both in equal measure. I’ve found books like Awareness and Radical Acceptance to be helpful.
If you don’t, you will end up with sand slipping through your fingers, leaving you with the same feelings of emptiness. Only now, along with disappointment, you will have the new challenges described in this post.
I also highly recommend reading Kevin Kelly’s essay entitled “1,000 True Fans.” Is it possible that being “famous” to the right 1,000 people could get you to your goals faster—and be healthier—than seeking the adoration and validation of millions? I tend to think so.
But then again…
Does that mean no one should pursue the path of Great Fame or tempt the sirens of the Great Public? I can’t say that. My intention is simply to shine light upon some of the hazards that such a journey entails. 
Perhaps—just perhaps—you should give stardom a shot.
After all, as Jim Carrey has said:
“I think everybody should get rich and famous, and do everything they ever dreamed of, so they can see that it’s not the answer.”

,,"The Worst Movie of 2025:
In the Sony email leaks in the amidst of the controversy surrounding The Interview, Amy Pascal famously said of the script for what would become Cameron Crowe’s Aloha: “It never not even once works.” Rarely do I echo such an iconically bitchy sentiment . Even my least favorite films of the decade - The Sweet East, Promising Young Woman, I’m Thinking of Ending things, Blonde - are not without disparate virtues. The same cannot be said, however, for Alpha, the newest film from Julia Ducornau. After being announced by an October release date before being unceremoniously pushed to March next year, the film has been sentenced to sporadic qualifying runs and being the least-touched disc in the NEON screener box set. Anyway, this AIDs paranoia period piece is irreparably vulgar, not least of which because of its saccharine and prescriptive allegory. Hypochondria being the converse of the marginalized person’s death drive is not an inherently wront premise, but this is certainly the wrong actualization. Unlike Titane, this is not sharp enough to avoid uncomfortable implications about queerness and stigmatized vices. These are so obviously unintentional, though, that they do not inspire frustration, indignation, or even indifference. The bigger problem is that no moment, no image, no performance charts at an appropriate register for the already broken material. I spent the entire film with my jaw on the floor. Nerve-wrackingly non-functional cinema.
The Best 2024 Films of 2025:
If you were curious where Caught By The Tides, Afternoons of Solitude, or Cloud would place, sorry/don’t worry: they were all on last year’s list.
The Best 2025 Film of 2024:
The Shrouds and Misericordia both made perfect, intuitive sense to me because people from my past are always trying to fuck me despite my autism/grief. Both of these will be unduly sidelined here, though, thanks to Godard’s Scénarios. The director’s final film is unfinished, and always presented alongside Exposé du film annonce du film Scénario - in which Godard, shortly before his death, methodically narrates the film’s storyboard, a scrapbook collage. The short itself is good, albeit messy and half-formed even when trying to assess its fragments in isolation. The most moving quality of Scenarios - both in its finished portions and as described by Godard himself - is how modern its preoccupations are. Godard’s visual jargon has made him the single most influential artist to ever work in film. His peers, disciples, and apostates alike cannot help but speak in a language he built. It feels like a gift to see this film now, to experience for the last time what it was like to watch Godard process history contemporaneously. For the auteur of all auteurs, it is devastating that the final shot of his career is not an image he created, but an image of his body, hours before his passing, still thinking about a film he will never make yet will live on anyway.

Honorable Mentions:
Sophy Romvari’s Blue Heron has been percolating in my belly, which was not where I expected to find the film months later. The film is full of gentle, gracious touches, but it is the agonizing, uncompromising construction that has stuck with me. Janus is releasing the film next year; I cannot think of a more perfect fit for the outfit, nor an artist more deserving of the platform.My “no friends on the best of list” seems to bite me in the ass every year and 2025 is no exception. Me and my arbitrary guidelines…
Black Bag is Soderbergh’s best movie, monogamy propaganda disguised as a shaggy-dog espionage trifle. I even like the vaseline-smeared, dilated-pupil lighting. I like basically everything about Amalia Ullman’s Magic Farm. The same goes for Die My Love, of whose virtues I gave an impassioned defense on this very newsletter last month. Perhaps some will be surprised that OBAA, which I called “the defining film of the 2020s,” is not on the proper Top 10. You can all blame Sean Penn’s acting coach for this.

,,"On a record-breaking day for crowd attendances in Australia, the loudest roar was reserved for Test opener Scott Boland edging a ball past gully for four. At any other time, you might think there's quite a bit not right with that statement. That is before you even add the fact that this was Australia's second innings and Boland had already batted once earlier. But not on this particular Boxing Day, when 94,199 packed the iconic MCG, the greatest number of people to have watched a day of Test cricket at a venue ever on Australian soil.
Only to see 20 wickets fall on a pitch that will be debated and discussed for a long time to come. The first time that had happened on Australian soil since 1950, which was in Brisbane during another Ashes Test.
And for the record, Boland was opening the batting as a night watcher for Jake Weatherald with Australia left to face one over late on Friday following two equally incredible batting collapses.
The fact that none of it seemed bizarre or outlandish, and if anything more inevitable in the lead-up to the fourth Test, sums up both where this Ashes series stands and also the make-up of most modern-day Test batters.
This is not to say that anyone would have necessarily predicted both teams to be bowled out before the close of play on Day One of a Test. But it did seem rather along expected lines that there was going to be minimal resistance shown by batters from both teams against high-quality seam bowling on a pitch with 10 mm of ""furry"" grass on top.
It's just the norm these days after all. There'd been plenty of trepidation around how the surface at the 'G would play as we got closer to Boxing Day. Steve Smith had hinted on the eve of the Test about how he expected it to be quite lively, and potentially spicier than what we saw here four years ago when Boland made his dramatic Test debut, when the match lasted less than seven sessions.
It's the same on a pitch in the subcontinent that's expected to be a raging turner as it is on one of these seamer-friendly tracks in this part of the world. Where you almost get a feeling that batters these days prefer pre-empting their approach to how they perceive the pitch to play rather than always adjusting or adapting to how it actually does.
These were indeed difficult batting conditions at the 'G today. It was one of the coldest starts to a Boxing Day Test, with the temperature ""feeling like 8 degrees"" when Ben Stokes won the toss and elected to field. There was definite seam movement, and significant amount of it, throughout the day. If anything, the pitch that started off slightly slow with rubber ball bounce, started to get quicker by the time England began losing their wickets in the third session of play. Conditions where there would be talk of the proverbial ball with the batter's name on it, and where run-scoring would be a tough ask, if not a hard grind.
But from the moment Travis Head edged a Gus Atkinson delivery on to his stumps early in the piece, there was a feeling that it would be a day where wickets will fall in clumps. Even if not many could have predicted the incredible frequency with which they did eventually.
On the face of it, close to 70 per cent of the 20 wickets that fell on the day could be deemed as being a result of batter error.
Surprise, surprise: Boland opens the batting for Australia! ©Getty
Let's go through them. Marnus Labuschagne had looked unsettled for most of his innings before getting squared up by a Josh Tongue delivery, and then playing a forceful drive to a full delivery off the next ball to be nicked off. Steve Smith had got some rhythm before he attempted an extravagant drive off a delivery that jagged back slightly from the Nottinghamshire seamer. Alex Carey was strangled down the leg-side to a trap that Ben Stokes had set for him while Usman Khawaja was caught behind by an Atkinson delivery that angled in from around the wicket and left him very late.
It wasn't always the wicket delivery that got the better of them, but instead the ones leading into them. Like how the straight ball does the most damage for spinners on big turners in the subcontinent.
The same could be said about the English innings. Ben Duckett and Ben Stokes fell to untoward shots, the opener in particular clearly looking out of sorts after what's been a difficult week for him.
But apart from Jamie Smith and Will Jacks, who fell prey to the prodigious movement from Boland from that Boland length on what is Boland's pitch, the rest of the wickets came via very good pieces of bowling either from Mitch Starc or Michael Neser playing in his first-ever red-ball Test.
That England would struggle to get close to Australia's paltry first innings total of 152 seemed evident even before their openers took strike was a sign of how this series has gone, and the lack of trust in England's batting resilience. And as predicted they barely managed to get their score into three-figures, courtesy some late boundaries from Atkinson.
The innings that really put the pitch into perspective, along with Australia's feelings about the brittle English batting, came from Mitch Starc. Even if it lasted all of six deliveries. For in those half-a-dozen balls that he faced, Starc couldn't have looked keener to be get his hands on the new-ball and start steaming in. Even if this was only the second session of Day One, and even if Australia had only gone past 150 on the board. Between that and Boland opening the batting in front of a raucous MCG crowd to close out proceedings, it was a day of cricket that was bizarre and strangely predictable in equal measure.

,,"Many businesses have the ambition of transforming around customer demand. One such business is mooh cooperative, a collection of Swiss dairy farmers, owned by its members. Mooh cooperative supplies milk from its members’ farms to four main customers who dominate the milk market.
But trading conditions are shifting. In the commodity milk market, the price paid to farmers is in decline. Changing consumer preferences are seeing milk alternatives boom in popularity. And government policies that have historically protected Swiss dairy farmers from competition abroad are under threat. This could open up the marketplace to dairy producers who offer lower prices but also lower welfare standards and different farming practices.
The CEO of mooh cooperative saw a leader in EY Studio+ giving a presentation about customer-centric business models, and the CEO approached EY Studio+ for help.
Mooh cooperative wanted to find an additional market for its milk to reduce its dependence on powerful B2B customers. Critically, any new venture could not be seen to be in competition with mooh cooperative’s main customers, which included dairy and cheese producers.
This kind of challenge is where EY Studio+ teams find opportunity and excel, enabling the EY organization to provide a boutique service that can provide results quickly.
EY Studio+ focuses on creating lasting corporate ventures – and it proposed exploring a digital business model directly targeting end consumers.

 The better the answer
Creating a sustainable startup in just weeks
A multidisciplinary team’s ideation, prototyping and testing turned an idea into a viable business.
Mooh cooperative gave the EY Studio+ team an ambitious challenge: find and pre-validate new business models in three months, then get it to market in four months. The EY Studio+ team was confident they could launch even faster.
This demanded a strategy to transform at incredible speed despite COVID-19 restrictions. And with funding provided by the co-operative’s members, failure was not an option.
EY Studio+ began by carrying out consumer research on the street to gather insights about the potential customer base for a new milk-based offering. With these insights, the EY Studio+ team created multiple consumer personas and developed more than 100 new business ideas. These were refined down to 15 concepts, which were designed and research-tested at an agricultural fair. Mooh cooperative saw the value of moving forward the five strongest concepts, all enabling the co-op to enter a new market: direct-to-consumer.
To test the five concepts, the EY Studio+ team helped mooh cooperative by targeting consumers through interest and behavior patterns on social media platforms as well as keywords on search engines. The EY Studio+ team also built prototype landing pages for the proposed products, releasing them into the market as if they were already developed and ready to sell. The implementation of a tracking system helped enable a broad evaluation of interaction, including the frequency that advertising was displayed, the number of clicks on the advert and the individual steps users took on the prototype website. This enabled data to be gathered on the popularity and likely success of the concepts. For example, consumers were asked to enter their postal code to see if the product was available in their area by tracking how many people chose to enter their details for different products, the relative popularity of each product could be assessed.
This data-led approach enabled EY Studio+ to report with confidence on the viability of different ideas and empower mooh cooperative to make more informed and forward-focused decisions about the future direction of their business while lowering the risks around their new digital business.
Of the five prototypes launched, there was one clear winner: cheezy, a premium cheese delivery service offering Swiss cheeses that research identified as not available in major supermarkets. Part of cheezy’s appeal was bringing the romance of the farm shop directly to people’s homes, and offering the opportunity to feel, smell and taste fresh produce. This is a connoisseur’s cheese experience, with options for one-off purchase and monthly subscriptions that enable customers to taste a range of quality regional cheeses throughout the year – without leaving their homes.
Cheezy targeted an unexplored niche that offered something surprising and new – and wanted – to consumers in Switzerland. There are many traditional cheese shops in Switzerland, but they often don’t have a holistic online presence. By comparison, cheezy offers an innovative consumer-centric digital presence with a stylish design that competes with the best cheese subscription services globally with an easy-to-use website, or an app, that make the ordering and billing process as smooth as possible. The concept had two further key aspects that appealed to mooh cooperative: firstly, most consumers recognize differences in quality between cheeses and are willing to pay accordingly for delicious cheese; and secondly, it takes a lot of milk to make cheese.
EY Studio+ then rapidly deployed a fully-fledged multidisciplinary corporate startup team including venture building professionals, online marketers, designers and product managers. Every aspect of the launch and rollout was detailed and in scope – even writing a job spec and conducting interviews for a new CEO for cheezy.
Throughout the project, the EY Studio+ team worked in close collaboration, and in preparation for launch, made decisions that would enable a seamless transition of handover for mooh cooperative’s new direct-to-consumer business. For example, the EY Studio+ team chose customized off-the-shelf platforms, like Shopify for ecommerce, which are quick to build and easy to use.
A premium experience had to be a hallmark of the cheezy brand, so EY Studio+ sourced and created high-quality product packaging including papers, silks and handwritten courtesy slips packed with each order. The EY Studio+ team also developed innovative and truly sustainable packaging solutions to keep the product safe and fresh in transit. These included a bag made of recyclable organic hemp fiber and a frozen bottle of fresh water to keep the temperature below 5°C – which could then be enjoyed when thawed.
The team effectively built a new business end-to-end – developing a brand, including visual identity, value proposition and the product language; securing delivery partners and negotiating terms; setting up a customer service arm; designing marketing campaigns; building a website; and testing the entire supply chain for legal compliance.

 The better the world works
A fast launch is the beginning of sustained success
Cheezy was up and running in just six weeks, and achieved its business case within one year.
Despite the ambitious launch time of three months, EY Studio+ helped establish the new cheezy business in just six weeks, which implemented pivotal aspects that enabled adjustments to be made to further improve sales and fulfilment processes.

Customer response40%of customers chose a subscription to cheezy in the first four months of launching.

In the first four months of launching, 40% of customers chose a subscription to cheezy. In the first year of business, cheezy reached thousands of customers with a moderate marketing budget and shipped more than 1,000 orders during the winter holiday season alone. Eighteen months later, many of the earliest customers are still active, with 80% rating the service as excellent. Today, it is trending toward becoming a sustainable online business – which is also reflected in a great customer satisfaction score of 4.7 out of 5 from Trustpilot.
Cheezy achieved its business case within the first year, and the organization is now working toward a mid-term ambition of providing 10% of mooh cooperative’s profit.
There was excellent co-operation between mooh cooperative and the EY Studio+ team throughout the project, and the speed and efficiency with which the well-rehearsed multidisciplinary team got to work was astounding.
René Schwager
CEO, mooh cooperative
Cheezy is also expanding as a global brand. Meanwhile, the company is forging stronger links with small-scale artisan cheesemakers, not only supplying milk but buying back cheese, to drive the value of cheezy further into the supply chain and expand the market of its co-operatives. Cheezy is also finding that customers are growing the size of their shopping baskets and wants to leverage the consumer experience, so they launched additional experience-based products, such as online cheese-tasting events.
 “There was excellent co-operation between mooh cooperative and the EY Studio+ team throughout the project, and the speed and efficiency with which the well-rehearsed multidisciplinary team got to work was astounding,” says René Schwager, CEO of mooh cooperative.
“It always felt like a startup rather than a big project, and at cheezy, we are taking the lean and agile methods we’ve learned and are now applying them fully to our core ongoing business,” says Schwager.
For many organizations, customer-centric business transformation may appear to be a lengthy, costly process with no guarantee of transformative results. But with an end-to-end approach based on research, insights, testing and iteration, the EY Studio+ team and cheezy demonstrated that it is truly possible to develop and launch a transformative business in under six months, even during a pandemic.

,,"What does a good coaching conversation look like?
On a different note: Linda Gross Cheliotes and Marceta Reilly are two coaches and academics who have suggested four reasons why a coaching conversation might run into problems:
The coach and coachee have different personal agendas
At least one has insufficient information to understand the other’s viewpoint
There is miscommunication due to poor listening or inattention to body language
A coach does not choose words carefully enough or asks closed questions, leading the coachee to feel judged, criticized, or defensive
These suggest things you can do to maximize the value you get from coaching and tell whether someone is the right coach for you:
Try making your personal agenda explicit (what do you want to get out of being coached?) and ask questions to determine whether your agenda is consistent or well-matched to your coaches. For example, if you’re someone who wants coaching because you want to find meaning in your life, you might not have an agenda that fits well with someone who specializes exclusively in career advancement - unless you’re happy with finding most or all of your meaning in life in your career.
Similarly, you can pay attention to whether you feel understood by your coach, which might involve asking helpful questions and listening well. If you do feel understood and you feel you understand what they’re saying and where they’re coming from, then you might have a good fit.
For point 4, the application is more obvious and might go without saying (but we’ll say it anyway): If your prospective coach makes you feel judged, criticized, or defensive, then you can do better. There are plenty more coaches in the sea.
