"Software engineers should be a little bit cynical
","sean goedecke
",https://www.seangoedecke.com/a-little-bit-cynical/,"I don’t see a hard distinction between engineers being “tools in a political game” and professionals who solve meaningful problems. In fact, I think that in practice almost all meaningful problems are solved by playing political games.
There are very few problems that you can solve entirely on your own. Software engineers encounter more of these problems than average, because the nature of software means that a single engineer can have huge leverage by sitting down and making a single code change. But in order to make changes to large products - for instance, to make it possible for GitHub’s 150M users to use LaTeX in markdown - you need to coordinate with many other people at the company, which means you need to be involved in politics.
It is just a plain fact that software engineers are not the movers and shakers in large tech organizations. They do not set the direction of the company. To the extent that they have political influence, it’s in how they translate the direction of the company into specific technical changes. But that is actually quite a lot of influence!
Large tech companies serve hundreds of millions (or billions) of users. Small changes to these products can have a massive positive or negative effect in the aggregate. As I see it, choosing to engage in the messy, political process of making these changes - instead of washing your hands of it as somehow impure - is an act of idealism.
I think the position of a software engineer in a large tech company is similar to people who go into public service: idealistically hoping that they can do some good, despite knowing that they themselves will never set the broad strokes of government policy.
Of course, big-tech software engineers are paid far better, so many people who go into this kind of work in fact are purely financially-motivated cynics. But I’m not one of them! I think it’s possible, by doing good work, to help steer the giant edifice of a large tech company for the better.
Cynicism as inoculation
Cynical writing is like most medicines: the dose makes the poison. A healthy amount of cynicism can serve as an inoculation from being overly cynical.
If you don’t have an slightly cynical explanation for why engineers write bad code in large tech companies - such as the one I write about here - you risk adopting an overly cynical one. For instance, you might think that big tech engineers are being deliberately demoralized as part of an anti-labor strategy to prevent them from unionizing, which is nuts. Tech companies are simply not set up to engage in these kind of conspiracies.
If you don’t have a slightly cynical explanation for why large tech companies sometimes make inefficient decisions - such as this one - you risk adopting an overly cynical one. For instance, you might think that tech companies are full of incompetent losers, which is simply not true. Tech companies have a normal mix of strong and weak engineers.

,,https://manus.im/blog/manus-stripe,"Go Live in an Hour: How Manus Reimagined Payments with Stripe
At Manus, we believe you should focus on your business idea, not the technical busywork required to bring it to life. One of the biggest hurdles has always been payments. You have a clear vision for what you want to sell, but you're forced to stop, leave your workflow, and become a payments expert just to get started, navigating dashboards, configuring webhooks, and juggling API keys.We knew there had to be a better way. That's why we've re-imagined the entire process from the ground up together with Stripe. Instead of you figuring out the technical steps, Manus does it for you. The result is the fastest, safest way to go from idea to income.
Here's how Manus makes it possible:
Build First, Sign Up Later
Traditionally, the first step is always to create a payment provider account. We've flipped that on its head.With Manus, you start building your business immediately. The moment you decide to add payments, Manus instantly creates a temporary, Stripe sandbox for you to start testing. There's no need to sign up for Stripe first. This is your personal, secure testing environment, ready for Manus to build and test your payment infrastructure.
Manus as Your Payments Specialist
Once your sandbox is created, Manus understands your goal and gets to work, handling the complex configuration tasks that used to take hours or days:•Automated Product Setup: Manus takes your business logic and automatically creates the corresponding products and subscription models in Stripe.•Webhook Configuration, Solved: Forget the complexity of setting up webhooks for payment confirmations. Manus configures them for you automatically, ensuring your application works seamlessly.•End-to-End Testing: Manus enables you to run through your entire checkout flow in a complete testing environment. You can test subscriptions and confirm that everything works exactly as expected, all without a single real dollar changing hands.
Testing Made Easy with Stripe's claimable sandbox
The magic behind this ""build first, sign up later"" workflow is a powerful piece of technology from Stripe called the Claimable Sandbox.Think of it as a temporary, fully-featured Stripe account that can be created programmatically—in our case, by Manus—without requiring any user signup.This is a game-changer for a few key reasons:•Zero-Friction Start: It removes the biggest obstacle to getting started: the signup form. You can begin building and testing your business idea immediately.•Ease of testing: The sandbox is a complete replica of Stripe's live environment. You can test every aspect of your payment flow, from creating subscriptions to handling failed payments, without affecting real customers or money. Only when you're satisfied with the website, do you then need to go to Stripe, go through KYC and then accept payments.•Designed for AI Agents: This technology is built for the new era of AI-driven development. It allows an agent like Manus to securely build and configure an entire payment system on your behalf in a controlled environment.Once you are satisfied with the setup, you ""claim"" the sandbox. This seamlessly transfers all the configurations Manus has built—your products, pricing, and webhook settings—to a new, permanent Stripe account that you own. You get a production-ready payment system from day one.
Claim and Go Live
When you're ready to start accepting real money, you simply tell Manus to go live. This is when you'll ""Claim"" your sandbox.This is the only point where you'll be prompted to officially create your Stripe account and complete their standard, secure KYC (Know Your Customer) process. Once approved, your fully configured, battle-tested payment system is instantly live.The entire process is managed through a simple, conversational interface within Manus.This is the power of the Claimable Sandbox workflow, an innovation from Stripe that Manus leverages to act as your agent, turning a complex, multi-day setup into a simple, one-hour process.
Your Vision, Brought to Life
You bring the vision. Manus provides the expertise to build it and the foundation to get paid—with confidence.Start building your business with Manus"

,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store,"iTunes Store is a digital marketplace selling songs, albums, music videos, ringtones and alert tones. It was launched by Apple Inc. on April 28, 2003, for Mac OS X, and on October 16, 2003, for Microsoft Windows. It launched as a mobile application with iOS on June 29, 2007.[1]
It previously sold mobile applications until the launch of the App Store on July 10, 2008, and e-books until the launch of the iBooks Store on March 31, 2010.[2] It also used to facilitate the downloading of podcasts which later became integrated into Apple Podcasts, as well as the provision to buy and rent films and TV shows which has since become integrated into Apple TV.[3]
The iTunes Store opened as part of then-CEO Steve Jobs' push to open a digital marketplace for music. When it launched, it was the only legal digital catalog of music to offer songs from all five major record labels, which played a part in its success and influenced the music downloading business.[4] Music streaming services began to overtake music downloading, with Apple launching Apple Music on June 30, 2015. Steve Jobs saw the opportunity to open a digital marketplace for music due to the rising popularity of easily downloadable tracks.[6][7][8][9] In 2002, Jobs made an agreement with the five major record labels to offer their content through iTunes.[10] The iTunes Music Store (later iTunes Store) was introduced by Jobs at a special Apple music event in April 2003.[11][12] Music could be purchased in the iTunes application, and purchases were playable in iTunes or on the iPod. The store was initially available to Mac computers,[13] and was later expanded to Microsoft Windows in October 2003 when iTunes for Windows was launched.[14]
In April 2008, the iTunes Store was the largest music vendor in the United States,[15] and in February 2010, it was the largest music vendor in the world.[16] The iTunes Store's revenues in the first quarter of 2011 totaled nearly US$1.4 billion.[17] By May 28, 2014, the store had sold 35 billion songs worldwide.[18]
In 2016, it was reported that music streaming services had overtaken digital downloads in sales.[19] It was reported that iTunes-style digital download sales had dropped 24% as streaming continued to increase.[20]
In April 2018, the iTunes app was added to the Microsoft Windows 10 app store.[21] Beginning in the spring of 2019, the iTunes app became available on Samsung Smart TVs.[22]
In October 2019, with the release of macOS Catalina, iTunes was split into separate Music, TV, and Podcasts apps. Apple's storefront for movies and television shows moved inside the TV app. Any music in users' iTunes library would transfer to the Music app, which would still offer access to the iTunes Store.

"
,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store,"The iTunes Store is available on most Apple devices, including the Mac (inside the Music app), the iPhone, the iPad, the iPod touch, and the Apple TV, as well as on Windows (inside iTunes). Video purchases from the iTunes Store are viewable on the Apple TV app on Roku[25] and Amazon Fire TV[26] devices and certain smart televisions. Unlike other Apple media services such as Apple Music or Apple TV+, there is no web-based interface for the iTunes Store with the exception of limited iTunes Preview pages; the desktop application has to be installed to browse the store. While initially a dominant player in digital media, by the mid-2010s, streaming media services were generating more revenue than the buy-to-own model used by the iTunes Store.[27][28]
Currently, iTunes is supported on the macOS (Leopard and above) and Microsoft Windows operating systems. iTunes was known to run passably well in Linux on x86-based computers using the Wine compatibility layer; however, by December 2011, this was no longer the case.[29] Users without iTunes installed can see a content database (but not hear or view the content itself) using the iTunes Preview service, which runs inside a web browser. This service also allows users to watch trailers for upcoming film releases. Should they choose to purchase any media, they will be redirected to iTunes.
Pricing model
History
Following the introduction of the iTunes Store, individual songs were all sold for the same price, though Apple introduced multiple prices in 2007. Music in the store is in the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format, which is the MPEG-4-specified successor to MP3. Originally, songs were only available with DRM and were encoded at 128 kbit/s. At the January 2009 Macworld Expo, Apple announced that all iTunes music would be made available without DRM, and encoded at the higher-quality rate of 256 kbit/s. Previously, this model, known as ""iTunes Plus"", had been available only for music from EMI and some independent labels. Users can sample songs by listening to previews, ninety seconds in length, or thirty seconds for short tracks.
In addition, the iTunes Store offers apps, which are applications used for various purposes (games, productivity, news, etc.) that are compatible with the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad, although some apps are specifically for the iPhone or iPad only. Some apps cost money (called ""Paid Apps"") and some are free (called ""Free Apps""). Developers can decide which prices they want to charge for apps, from a pre-set list of pricing tiers, from free to several hundred dollars. When someone downloads an App, 70 percent of the purchase goes to the developer(s), and 30 percent goes to Apple.[30]

,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store,"Sony Music Entertainment (SME), commonly known as Sony Music, is an American multinational music company owned by Sony Group Corporation. It is the recording division of Sony Music Group, with the other half being the publishing division, Sony Music Publishing.[4]
Founded in 1929 as American Record Corporation, it was acquired by the Columbia Broadcasting System in 1938 and renamed Columbia Recording Corporation. In 1966, the company was reorganized to become CBS Records. Sony bought the company in 1988 and renamed it SME in 1991. In 2004, Sony and Bertelsmann established a 50–50 joint venture known as Sony BMG to handle the operations of Sony Music and Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG), but Sony bought out Bertelsmann's stake four years later and reverted to using the 1991 company name. This buyout led to labels formerly under BMG ownership, including Arista, Jive, LaFace and J Records into former BMG and currently Sony's co-flagship record label, RCA Records, in 2011 and led to the relaunch of BMG as BMG Rights Management. Arista Records would later be revived in 2018.
On July 17, 2019, Sony announced a merger of Sony Music Entertainment and music publishing arm Sony/ATV to form the Sony Music Group.[5] The merger was completed on August 1, 2019.[6][7]
As of 2025, Sony Music Entertainment is the second largest of the ""Big Three"" record companies, behind Universal Music Group and followed by Warner Music Group. Its music publishing division Sony Music Publishing is the largest music publisher in the world.
Sony Music UK was founded in January 1980 and is owned and operated by Sony Music Entertainment in the United Kingdom. Since 2014, Jason Iley has been chairman and CEO of Sony Music UK.[74] Though owned by Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Music UK has standalone operations in the UK to promote musicians within the UK.[75]
In June 2017, it was announced that Sony would be merging its two independent distribution companies The Orchard and Red Essential.[76]
In 2014, Sony had its best singles success of 33 years, with 11 number 1 singles. Sony Music artists won a total of five individual awards at the BRITs 2015, including Best Female Solo Artist for Paloma Faith, and Mark Ronson's ""Uptown Funk"", which picked up Best British Single. Several other of the label's artists – Foo Fighters, One Direction and Pharrell Williams – also collected awards.[77][78]
Sony's performance at the BRITs 2015 was the label's best in nearly 20 years, winning a total of 5 awards. In 2017, Sony Music UK celebrated the most successful BRIT Awards in the company's history, winning seven of the 11 awards.[79]
Sony Music UK has made key acquisitions including forming Insanity Records with Insanity Management. Craig David became the first artist to sign an album deal with Insanity Records.[80][81] Sony Music UK signed Robbie Williams, who released his 11th album The Heavy Entertainment Show in 2016. Jason Iley commented that the agreement was ""a once in a lifetime signing with the biggest male solo artist of our generation"".[82][83]
Sony Music UK incorporated the independent sales and distribution company Essential Music and Marketing – renamed to Red Essential. In August 2016, Sony Music acquired Ministry of Sound Recordings, home to London Grammar, DJ Fresh and Sigala.[84][85]
On April 5, 2017, two of Sony Music UK's labels won awards at the annual Music Week Awards. Columbia Records was awarded A&R of the Year, and Syco was awarded Record Company of the Year.[86]
In 2021, Sony agreed to buy Kobalt neighboring rights division and independent distribution company AWAL, from the Kobalt Music Group for $430 million.[87]
In 2024, the former members of Pink Floyd sold their entire catalog for $400 million to Sony.[88] Previously, the band had licensed their music to Sony (from 1975 to 1999 and then again from 2016 until the sale) outside Europe, where the distribution was handled by EMI and later Warner Music Group. Alongside this, they had also acquired Queen's catalog and ""name and likeness"" rights for £1 billion.[89][90] Sony will start distributing the entirety of Queen's music internationally (outside of North America, where it remains with Disney's Hollywood Records) by 2026, when their deal with Universal Music Group ends.[91][92]

Stringer was listed Second on the 2022 Billboard ""Power 100"" ranking of persons influential in the music industry.[2]
Stringer was born and raised in the town of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and attended Aylesbury Grammar School.[3] He got his first record player at age seven and attended his first concert at age 12 at Wembley Arena where the line up included The Beach Boys and The Eagles.[4]
Growing up in Aylesbury, Stringer had the opportunity to see a number of touring bands. In 1976, at the age of 14, he saw The Clash at one of their earliest shows.[3] He went on to spend his teenage years watching punk bands at the Aylesbury rock venue, Friars, where he began working during school holidays. He later said that while he ""saw the cultural side"" of the club, ""the business side rubbed off on me too.”[5]
After leaving school, Stringer studied sociology at Goldsmiths College in South London.[4] Whilst at university, he spent a year working as a student entertainment manager, booking acts such as Simply Red.

,,https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/,"NEW: You can now search for Apple Music playlists, albums and stations with my new Apple Music Artwork Finder which includes uncompressed artwork and animated artwork where applicable.
NEW: I've created a new tool, Apple TV Shows & Movies Artwork Finder, to support the new 16:9 aspect ratio used in the TV app in iOS 12.3, macOS Catalina, and Apple TV. There is also a whole host of additional artwork including ultrawide banners, logos, and parallax files.
This project started out as a simple tool for using the iTunes Search API to download 600x600px artwork for TV shows. However, it became a lot more popular than I expected and requests were made to add movie and iBook artwork. I've added these in addition to incorporating album artwork and app icons from the App Store.
To find artwork, simply type the name below and choose the media type and country from the dropdowns.
I've included two links at the top of each piece of artwork; standard resolution and high resolution. The standard resolution will generally be 600x600px and is the size that is displayed inline. The high resolution can be anything; I've found instances of movie artwork at 1600x2400px and TV shows up to 2400x2400px. However, the high resolution does not always work, particularly for iBooks, Movies, and Albums (albums are now working thanks to a tip from John Leustek). It seems to depend on the country and studio involved but you generally need a special key to get that high res artwork and you can only get that key by purchasing something from iTunes (and then it only lasts a short while). With app icons, there is only one artwork link which will give you a 1024x1024px file; just click on the app icon.
Some movies weren't being found even though they could be viewed in iTunes. To fix this, copy the URL from iTunes and paste the numbers after 'id' into the 'Apple ID (Movie)' section. For example, if the iTunes URL is https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/harry-potter-philosophers/id314918278 you would put 314918278 as the id (the country must be correct as well for this to work). As of March 2016, you can also do this for albums; just select 'Apple ID (Album)' from the dropdown list.
IMPORTANT: This website gets artwork directly from iTunes. If the film / TV show you are looking for is not available on iTunes (i.e. it's a film that hasn't been released yet or is a network exclusive like a Netflix show) then you won't find it here. Please do not email me asking to add extra artwork as it doesn't work that way - this is just a quick way of getting artwork from iTunes.
NOTE TO DEVELOPERS: If you want to do any automation or hit the API I've written directly, please consider getting the source code I've made publicly available on GitHub and hosting it yourself. I can't guarantee uptime nor give permission for you to hit my server from your own apps so please host the code above on your own server if you wish to do anything like that.

,,https://bendodson.com/weblog/,"For over a decade, I’ve been providing a way to easily access high-resolution album artwork through my iTunes Artwork Finder and Apple Music Artwork Finder. These tools allow you to uncover the original, uncompressed artwork files exactly as they were delivered to Apple by the artist or their label — no compression, no quality loss, just high quality imagery.
Over the years, I’ve received countless messages from users who loved these tools but wished for more; specifically, the ability to fetch multiple pieces of artwork at once or automate the process…
Today, I’m thrilled to announce an Apple Shortcut that lets you do just that, now available exclusively on Gumroad.
With this new shortcut, all you need is an Apple Music URL. Feed it in, and you’ll get back a direct link to the highest resolution, uncompressed artwork available. I’ve also created a demo shortcut that shows you how to use this tool as part of a larger automation. Imagine easily inputting a URL and having the artwork automatically downloaded to your device. It’s that simple.
This shortcut isn’t just limited to album artwork. It works with playlists, stations, artists, music videos, and curators too. Essentially, if it’s on Apple Music, you can get the artwork.
I’m genuinely excited to see how people will use this shortcut. If there’s enough interest, I might expand this functionality to include my other artwork finders. If that’s something you’d like to see, let me know!

,,https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07437v2,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [34] efficiently enhances the performance of generative language models through integrating information retrieval techniques. It addresses a critical challenge faced by standalone generative language models: the tendency to produce responses that, while plausible, may not be grounded in facts. By retrieving relevant information from external sources, RAG significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations [23] or factually incorrect outputs, thereby improving the content’s reliability and richness. [73] This fusion of retrieval and generation capabilities enables the creation of responses that are not only contextually appropriate but also informed by the most current and accurate information available, making RAG a development in the pursuit of more intelligent and versatile language models [73, 64].
Numerous studies of RAG systems have emerged from various perspectives since the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) [55, 45, 59, 42, 41, 69, 16]. The RAG system comprises two primary components: Retrieval and Generation. The retrieval component aims to extract relevant information from various external knowledge sources. It involves two main phases, indexing and searching. Indexing organizes documents to facilitate efficient retrieval, using either inverted indexes for sparse retrieval or dense vector encoding for dense retrieval [16, 12, 28]. The searching component utilizes these indexes to fetch relevant documents on the user’s query, often incorporating the optional rerankers [4, 39, 6, 52] to refine the ranking of the retrieved documents. The generation component utilizes the retrieved content and question query to formulate coherent and contextually relevant responses with the prompting and inferencing phases. As the “Emerging” ability [59] of LLMs and the breakthrough in aligning human commands [42], LLMs are the best performance choices model for the generation stage. Prompting methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) [60], Tree of Thgouht [65], Rephrase and Respond (RaR) [8] guide better generation results. In the inferencing step, LLMs interpret the prompted input to generate accurate and in-depth responses that align with the query’s intent and integrate the extracted information [35, 9] without further finetuning, such as fully finetuning [16, 1, 67, 68] or LoRA [21]. Appendix 0.A details the complete RAG structure. Figure 1 illustrates the structure of the RAG systems as mentioned. The importance of evaluating RAG is increasing in parallel with the advancement of RAG-specific methodologies. On the one hand, RAG is a complex system intricately tied to specific requirements and language models, resulting in various evaluation methods, indicators, and tools, particularly given the black-box LLM generation. Evaluating RAG systems involves specific components and the complexity of the overall system assessment. On the other hand, the complexity of RAG systems is further compounded by the external dynamic database and the various downstream tasks, such as content creation or open domain question answering [16, 70]. These challenges necessitate the development of comprehensive evaluation metrics that can effectively capture the interplay between retrieval accuracy and generative quality [2, 7]. To clarify the elements further, we try to address the current gaps in the area, which differs from the prior RAG surveys [74, 16, 24] that predominantly collected specific RAG methods or data. We have compiled 12 distinct evaluation frameworks, encompassing a range of aspects of the RAG system. Following the procedure of making benchmarks, we analyze through targets, datasets and metrics mentioned in these benchmarks and summarize them into A Unified Evaluation Process of RAG (Auepora) as three corresponding phases.
For this paper, we contribute in the following aspects:

Challenge of Evaluation: This is the first work that summarizes and classifies the challenges in evaluating RAG systems through the structure of RAG systems, including three parts retrieval, generation, and the whole system.
2. 
Analysis Framework: In light of the challenges posed by RAG systems, we introduce an analytical framework, referred to as A Unified Evaluation Process of RAG (Auepora), which aims to elucidate the unique complexities inherent to RAG systems and guide for readers to comprehend the effectiveness of RAG benchmarks across various dimensions
3. 
RAG Benchmark Analysis: With the help of Auepora, we comprehensively analyze existing RAG benchmarks, highlighting their strengths and limitations and proposing recommendations for future developments in RAG system evaluation.
2Challenges in Evaluating RAG Systems
Evaluating hybrid RAG systems entails evaluating retrieval, generation and the RAG system as a whole. These evaluations are multifaceted, requiring careful consideration and analysis. Each of them encompasses specific difficulties that complicate the development of a comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks for RAG systems.
Retrieval
The retrieval component is critical for fetching relevant information that informs the generation process. One primary challenge is the dynamic and vast nature of potential knowledge bases, ranging from structured databases to the entire web. This vastness requires evaluation metrics that can effectively measure the precision, recall, and relevance of retrieved documents in the context of a given query [52, 32]. Moreover, the temporal aspect of information, where the relevance and accuracy of data can change over time, adds another layer of complexity to the evaluation process [6]. Additionally, the diversity of information sources and the possibility of retrieving misleading or low-quality information pose significant challenges in assessing the effectiveness of filtering and selecting the most pertinent information [39]. The traditional evaluation indicators for retrieval, such as Recall and Precision, cannot fully capture the nuances of RAG retrieval systems, necessitating the development of more nuanced and task-specific evaluation metrics [49].
Generation
The generation component, powered by LLMs, produces coherent and contextually appropriate responses based on the retrieved content. The challenge here lies in evaluating the faithfulness and accuracy of the generated content to the input data. This involves not only assessing the factual correctness of responses but also their relevance to the original query and the coherence of the generated text [75, 49]. The subjective nature of certain tasks, such as creative content generation or open-ended question answering, further complicates the evaluation, as it introduces variability in what constitutes a “correct” or “high-quality” response [48].
RAG System as a Whole
Evaluating the whole RAG system introduces additional complexities. The interplay between the retrieval and generation components means that the entire system’s performance cannot be fully understood by evaluating each component in isolation [49, 14]. The system needs to be assessed on its ability to leverage retrieved information effectively to improve response quality, which involves measuring the added value of the retrieval component to the generative process. Furthermore, practical considerations such as response latency and the ability to handle ambiguous or complex queries are also crucial for evaluating the system’s overall effectiveness and usability [39, 6].
Conclusion
Evaluating the target shift from traditional absolute numeric metrics to multi-source and multi-target generation evaluation, along with the intricate interplay between retrieval and generation components, poses significant challenges. [5, 50] Searches in a dynamic database may lead to misleading results or contradict the facts. Diverse and comprehensive datasets that accurately reflect real-world scenarios are crucial. Challenges also arise in the realm of metrics, encompassing generative evaluation criteria for distinct downstream tasks, human preferences, and practical considerations within the RAG system. Most prior benchmarks predominantly tackle one or several aspects of the RAG assessment but lack a comprehensive, holistic analysis.
3A Unified Evaluation Process of RAG (Auepora)
To facilitate a deeper understanding of RAG benchmarks, we introduce A Unified Evaluation Process of RAG (Auepora), which focuses on three key questions of benchmarks: What to Evaluate? How to Evaluate? How to Measure? which correlated to Target, Dataset, and Metric respectively. We aim to provide a clear and accessible way for readers to comprehend the complexities and nuances of RAG benchmarking.
The Target module is intended to determine the evaluation direction. The Dataset module facilitates the comparison of various data constructions in RAG benchmarks. The final module, Metrics, introduces the metrics that correspond to specific targets and datasets used during evaluation. Overall, it is designed to provide a systematic methodology for assessing the effectiveness of RAG systems across various aspects by covering all possible pairs at the beginning between the “Evaluable Outputs” (EOs) and “Ground Truths” (GTs). In the following section, we will explain thoroughly Aueporaand utilize it for introducing and comparing the RAG benchmarks.
Figure 2:The Target modular of the Auepora.
3.1Evaluation Target (What to Evaluate?)
The combination of EOs and GTs in the RAG system can generate all possible targets, which is the fundamental concept of the Auepora (as shown in Figure 1). Once identified, these targets can be defined based on a specific pair of EOs or EO with GT, as illustrated in Figure 2, and used to analyze all aspects of current RAG benchmarks.
3.1.1Retrieval
The EOs are the relevant documents for evaluating the retrieval component depending on the query. Then we can construct two pairwise relationships for the retrieval component, which are Relevant Documents ↔ Query, Relevant Documents ↔ Documents Candidates.
- 
Relevance (Relevant Documents ↔ Query) evaluates how well the retrieved documents match the information needed expressed in the query. It measures the precision and specificity of the retrieval process.
- 
Accuracy (Relevant Documents ↔ Documents Candidates) assesses how accurate the retrieved documents are in comparison to a set of candidate documents. It is a measure of the system’s ability to identify and score relevant documents higher than less relevant or irrelevant ones.

,,https://arxiv.org/html/2501.00553v3,"Nuclear fragmentation cross section measurements are crucial for advancing in several fields, including Particle Therapy (PT), Radioprotection in Space (RPS) and nuclear structure studies [1, 2]. For instance, in PT understanding the fragmentation of ion beams as they interact with human tissue can potentially improve cancer treatments, as it helps in accurately predicting the dose distribution and minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues [3, 4]. Moreover, an accurate description of fragmentation phenomena can also shed light on the biological effectiveness in proton therapy [5].
Similarly, in RPS these measurements would be of great importance for assessing the risks posed by cosmic radiation to astronauts, as they help in developing effective shielding strategies [6]. Indeed, space radiation constitutes one of the major risks for space exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) which is among future plans of several national space agencies and private companies [7]. Radiation hazards could be so important to prevent deep space missions due to huge costs and unacceptable risks for the astronauts given the lack of effective countermeasures so far [8].
These fields share a common ground both for ions involved (ranging from 1H to 56Fe with a focus on ions with nuclear charge number Z≤8) and kinetic energies 100−1000 MeV/nucleon (depending on the ion). However, the phenomena at play are known with poor accuracy due to the lack or the poor precision of the relevant fragmentation cross section measurements [9, 10, 11]. This translates in a poor precision in the computation of the biological dose due to the fragments with respect to the one required for both PT and RPS applications [12, 13]. The measurement of the missing fragmentation cross sections would allow to benchmark and update the existing nuclear models implemented in Monte Carlo (MC) and deterministic codes, used for the dose computation in both the PT and RPS applications [14, 15]. Double differential cross sections in the fragment production angle and kinetic energy would be of great value to this purpose. Despite recent progress, only a small number of beam-target-energy combinations have been explored [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].
The FOOT experiment [23] has been designed to address this data deficit by measuring fragmentation cross sections in the nuclear interactions between ion beams (such as protons, Helium, Carbon, and Oxygen) and targets of interest for PT, like H, C and O, which are the most abundant elements in tissues. It also includes targets of interest for shielding in RPS like hydrogen-enriched targets [23]. FOOT is a fixed target experiment whose setup includes two complementary configurations: an electronic setup with a magnetic spectrometer and charge/mass identification capabilities, for measuring forward emitted fragments with Z ≥ 2, and an emulsion spectrometer for higher angular acceptance measurements of fragments with Z ≤ 3. Details of the FOOT experiment design and some preliminary results can be found in [23, 24, 25]. This study analyzes data acquired at the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research facility in Darmstadt in 2021 with the electronic setup. At that time only a part of the final FOOT detector, as described in detail in [23], was operational. The setup, consisting of a detector for the beam monitoring and a system for the Time-of-Flight and the energy loss measurements, was used to identify the charge Z of the fragments and to measure their emission angle allowing to perform elemental cross section measurements. The same setup was used in a previous data acquisition campaign in 2019 in GSI, described in detail in [24].
This paper presents the measurement of the angular differential cross sections for the forward production of 2≤Z≤7 nuclei in the fragmentation process of a 400 MeV/nucleon 16O beam interacting with a graphite target. In terms of statistics and results, this work extends and supersedes the 2019 study [24], where a limited statistics allowed to measure only elemental fragmentation cross section integrated in the full geometrical acceptance of the setup. The present work provided more than a factor of 100 improvement in statistics compared to the previous campaign which allowed measurement of the angular differential cross sections for charged fragments with FOOT. In Sec. II the FOOT setup used in this analysis, its performance and the data collected are described. In Sec. III the analysis strategy to measure cross sections is discussed. Systematic uncertainties from detector effects and the analysis method are also assessed. In Sec. IV the results of the paper are discussed taking into account previous studies and earlier works of the FOOT experiment [24] with a focus on the improvements enabled by higher statistics and enhanced analysis techniques while in Sec. V a comparison between experimental results and predictions of Monte Carlo models in FLUKA and Geant4 is presented.
IIMaterial and methods
II.1Experimental setup
The experimental setup used in the data campaign analyzed in this paper is identical to the one used in the GSI 2019 data taking campaign and described in detail in [24] (see Figure 1). The fragmentation due to the interaction of a 16O beam of 400 MeV/nucleon with a 5 mm graphite target (TG) is studied. Two detectors, upstream the graphite target, the Start Counter (SC) and the Beam Monitor (BM) measure the incoming Oxygen ions. Their design minimizes the pre-target overall material budget in order to keep the fragmentation interactions inside themselves at the percentage level with respect to the one in the target. Downstream of the target, the only detector is the TOF Wall (TW) able to provide identification of the charge Z of the fragments [24]. The FOOT detector was installed in the Cave-A (HTA) of the GSI facility. The FWHM beam size was (0.5,0.4) cm in (X,Y) and the beam intensity was kept in the interval (0.5-1.0) kHz in order to keep the pile-up from Oxygen ions to a sustainable rate for the FOOT detectors.
Figure 1:Schematic view of the GSI experimental setup. The 16O beam passes through the Start Counter and the Beam Monitor, before impinging on the 5 mm thick graphite target. The produced fragments emitted with a polar angle ≤5.7∘ can be identified by the TOF Wall detector, about 193 cm downstream of the target [24].
The Start Counter [26] is a 250 μm thick plastic scintillator (EJ-228), placed at the very beginning of the setup, which measures the number of the incoming 16O ions and provides the start of the time of flight (TOF) measurement with a resolution of ∼ 70 ps [27]. The Beam Monitor is a drift chamber consisting of twelve wire layers, with X-Y views. With a tracking efficiency higher than 90% and a lower limit on the spatial resolution of 60⁢μ⁢m [28], it provides the measurement of the direction and the interacting point of the beam ions on the target. The distances between SC, BM and TG have been minimized as much as possible. This choice minimizes the effects of the multiple scattering and maximizes the position resolution on the BM track projection on the TG.
The TOF Wall detector is composed of two layers of 20 plastic scintillator bars (EJ-200) each, arranged orthogonally to provide X-Y views. This setup forms a 40×40⁢cm2 active area detector providing the measurements of the energy deposited ΔE, with a resolution of σ⁢(Δ⁢E)/Δ⁢E∼5 %, the TOF stop, with a resolution of ∼ 20 ps for 16O ions [27], and the hit position with the granularity provided by the bar crossing dimension of 2×2 cm2. To ensure that most fragments (except protons and neutrons) are fully measured, the TW is positioned approximately 193 cm downstream of the target. MC simulations and prior measurements [23, 15] showed that this arrangement maximizes the detector’s coverage for He fragments emitted within a maximum angle of 10∘ and consequently also for heavier ions. The position of the TW was chosen to minimize multiple hits within the fixed granularity. According to a MC simulations the chosen granularity keeps the pile-up of multiple fragments in the same bars cross below 1% [24, 23]. The TW detector was not optimized for the detection of neutrons and protons and these products were not analyzed. The TW dimension and distances from the target set the geometrical acceptance of the setup. Taking into account also a 1 cm shift between the center of the upstream region (SC, BM and TG) with respect to the one of the TW, the polar angle acceptance for this analysis is θ≤5.7∘.
Charge Z identification
The simultaneous measurement of the ΔE in each TW bar and the TOF between that bar and the SC allowed the identification of the nuclear charge (Z) of that ion. As detailed in [24], from a parametrization with a Bethe-Bloch curve of the ΔE as a function of TOF, for each TW layer, the charge Z of each fragment was extracted. A fragment crossing the TW hits a pair of X and Y bars, each with an assigned Z coordinate, thus identifying the point of passage of the fragment. The two bars are associated to the same fragment and clusterized in a TW point, with a position resolution provided by the bar crossing of 2×2 cm2. In order to have a clean Z identification, only pairs of X-Y bars sharing the same reconstructed Z are selected and clusterized in a TW point [24]. The fragment hit position along the bar, extracted with the time difference measured at both the edges of a single bar, is used to improve the clusterization of the X-Y bars forming a TW point [24]. This is fundamental whenever more than one fragment hits the TW in the same event. The ΔE and TOF assigned to each TW point is the average between the ones of the two bars forming it. In order to show the separation of the different fragments charge Z in Fig. 2 the Bethe-Bloch curves used for the charge Z identification (ZID) of the fragment are super

,,https://arxiv.org/html/2512.23601v1,"Large language models (LLMs) have significant potential for generating educational questions and problems, enabling educators to create large-scale learning materials. However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the “Artificial Hivemind” effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas’s theory of creativity and Guilford’s framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM’s reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of domains, and their applications are becoming increasingly widespread. In education, LLMs have shown particular promise for generating questions and problems, such as topic-specific questions DBLP:conf/lak/LiCB25; DBLP:conf/emnlp/0001LB21, problems at varying difficulty levels DBLP:conf/aied/JiaoSCZS23; DBLP:conf/aied/YuKL25; DBLP:conf/aaai/ElkinsKCS24, mathematically valid problems DBLP:conf/emnlp/0001LB21, and high-quality programming problems DBLP:conf/aied/NguyenPGTS25. While LLMs support educators by enabling scalable problem creation, a fundamental limitation threatens their effectiveness in this domain. Prior work has shown that LLMs exhibit the “Artificial Hivemind” effect hivemind, which is characterized by repetition within a single model and homogeneity across different models. As a result, students may be exposed to LLM-generated problems that are overly similar and repetitive, which can harm the collective diversity of thought and creativity.
Existing work has proposed several methods to mitigate this homogeneity of LLM outputs. A naive method is to use a high decoding temperature, which increases surface-level diversity but does not improve originality and can even reduce creativity lu2024discussion. Other methods use external information such as persona simulation to steer models toward different perspectives DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2406-20094 or contextualized prompting to add thematic constraints that guide generation DBLP:conf/aied/NguyenPGTS25. More advanced methods include fine-tuning with creativity signals to explicitly optimize for novelty and diversity ismayilzada-etal-2025-creative or multi-LLM discussion frameworks that enhance creativity through role-play and debate among multiple agents lu2024discussion. However, a limitation shared by these methods is that they do not fundamentally change the underlying reasoning process. When prompted directly for creative outputs, LLMs often immediately attempt to satisfy all constraints, leading to premature convergence that prunes creative exploration.
Our approach, drawing inspiration from Wallas’s classical theory of creativity wallas1926art and Guilford’s divergent-convergent thinking guilford1956structure, addresses this limitation by explicitly scaffolding the LLM’s reasoning into two distinct phases. In the divergent thinking phase, the model explores the creative space freely by generating wildly different, unconventional ideas without the cognitive burden of satisfying task constraints. In the convergent thinking phase, the model selects promising ideas and refines them to meet all requirements. By decoupling exploration from constraint satisfaction, our approach enables the LLM to traverse a broader ideation space before committing to a final answer. While prior work has applied divergent-convergent frameworks to classification tasks parekh-etal-2025-dicore, creative problem-solving DBLP:conf/naacl/TianRQ0MP00B24, and human-AI co-creation interfaces wen2025explorationvsfixationscaffolding, our work provides a novel contribution by applying this framework to scaffold automated creative problem generation.
Our contributions are as follows:
1. 
We propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that scaffolds divergent and convergent thinking in the LLM’s reasoning process for creative problem generation.
2. 
We instantiate this paradigm for creative programming problem generation in our experiments. Then, we evaluate our method using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity and novelty, both lexically and semantically, as well as utility.
3. 
We show that CreativeDC achieves significantly greater diversity and novelty than baseline methods, while maintaining high utility across diverse input contexts. Moreover, CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems than the baselines2.2Metrics for Evaluating Creativity
Creativity is inherently multi-dimensional Runco2012TheSD; DBLP:books/daglib/0022902, and recent work has emphasized the importance of simultaneously assessing diversity/novelty and utility (quality), highlighting trade-offs between these often competing objectives shypula2025evaluating; padmakumar2025measuringllmnoveltyfrontier. Following these multi-dimensional evaluation approaches, we evaluate creativity across three complementary dimensions: diversity, novelty, and utility.
Diversity.
Diversity measures the variation among the K problems in 𝒮. We evaluate diversity using both lexical and semantic metrics.
Lexical Diversity. We measure lexical diversity as the ratio of unique n-grams to the total number of n-grams across the set. A higher score indicates richer wording with less repetition. Let ngramsn​(𝒫) denote the multiset of n-grams extracted from problem 𝒫. Lexical diversity is defined as: LexDivn​(𝒮)=|⋃𝒫∈𝒮ngramsn​(𝒫)|/∑𝒫∈𝒮|ngramsn​(𝒫)|.
Semantic Diversity. To capture diversity beyond surface lexical overlap, we evaluate the semantic diversity of the set 𝒮 as the average pairwise cosine distance between problem embeddings. A higher score indicates greater semantic variety among the K problems. Let 𝐞​(𝒫)∈ℝd denote the embedding of problem 𝒫. Semantic diversity is defined as: SemDiv​(𝒮)=1/(K2)​∑i<jdcos​(𝐞​(𝒫i),𝐞​(𝒫j)).
Novelty.
While diversity measures variation within the set 𝒮, novelty captures how distinct the problems in 𝒮 are from an external reference corpus ℛ. Prior work typically computes novelty against large-scale web corpora DBLP:conf/iclr/LuSHM0HEJCD025, which are vast but semantically sparse, and finding a close match for a specific creative output is unlikely unless it is near-plagiarism. We adopt a more challenging evaluation setting. For each generation method, we construct ℛ from the pool of problems generated by all other methods on the same context 𝒞. This creates a semantically dense reference corpus where all problems share the same themes, programming concepts, and similar LLM-generation patterns. This setting provides a conservative lower bound on real-world novelty, as achieving high novelty against such a closely matched reference is considerably harder than against generic web text.
Lexical Novelty. We measure the proportion of n-grams in a generated problem that do not appear in the reference corpus. For a problem 𝒫∈𝒮 and reference corpus ℛ, the lexical novelty is: LexNovn​(𝒫,ℛ)=|ngramsn​(𝒫)∖⋃𝒫′∈ℛngramsn​(𝒫′)|/|ngramsn​(𝒫)|. A higher score indicates more distinctive phrasing relative to other methods’ outputs. We report this metric averaged across all problems in 𝒮.
Semantic Novelty. To capture novelty beyond surface level, we compute the minimum cosine distance between a problem embedding and the embeddings of all problems in the reference corpus: SemNov​(𝒫,ℛ)=min𝒫′∈ℛ⁡dcos​(𝐞​(𝒫),𝐞​(𝒫′)). This measures how far each problem lies from its nearest semantic neighbor in the reference set. Higher values indicate more semantically novel outputs. We report the average over all problems in 𝒮.
Utility.
Utility measures the quality of each generated problem 𝒫∈𝒮 with respect to the given context 𝒞. We evaluate utility along three binary dimensions: (1) Validity: the problem is solvable and the test suite must be correct and complete; (2) Context Relevance: the problem is related to the theme specified in 𝒞 and requires the given programming concepts to solve; and (3) Comprehensibility: the description 𝒫desc provides sufficient information to solve the problem. The utility of a problem is defined as the product of these three binary indicators: Utility​(𝒫)=𝟏​[Validity]×𝟏​[Context Relevance]×𝟏​[Comprehensibility], which equals 1 only when all three criteria are satisfied, and 0 otherwise. We evaluate utility using an LLM-as-a-judge approach by using a strong LLM to assess context relevance and comprehensibility, and generates a solution program that we execute against 𝒫eval to verify validity, following prior work DBLP:conf/nips/ZhengC00WZL0LXZ23; hivemind; DBLP:conf/aied/NguyenPGTS25; padmakumar2025measuringllmnoveltyfrontier. We define the utility of a set 𝒮 as the percentage of problems in 𝒮 that achieve utility 1: Utility​(𝒮)=1|𝒮|​∑𝒫∈𝒮𝟏​[Utility​(𝒫)=1]×100.
2.3Objective
Our objective is to design a method that, given a context 𝒞, generates a set of problems 𝒮K​(𝒞) that maximizes diversity and novelty while maintaining high utility. This objective is challenging because diversity and novelty often conflict with utility constraints padmakumar2025measuringllmnoveltyfrontier.
